,139 Appeals from the orders of the High Court of Judicature at Patna (Manohar Lall and Imam JJ.) in Miscellaneous Ap peals Nos.
,108 to 111 of 1948.
COUNSEL,Shambhu Barmeswar Prasad and Ramanugrah Prasad for the appellants.
COUNSEL,H.J. Umrigar for the respondents.
,January 12.
JUDGE,The Judgment of the Court was delivered by CHANDRASEKHARA AIYAR J.
FACTS,"The decision of these four ap peals, which are connected with each other and which have arisen out of orders made by the High Court of Patna in four Miscellaneous Appeals, depends on the interpretation of section 7 of the Bihar Moneylenders (Regulation of Transac tions) Act, 1939."
FACTS,"The facts which have led to the appeals are found brief ly stated in the petition filed by the present appellants in the 3rd Court of Sub Judge, Patna, and may be re stated here for convenient reference : ""The father of the petitioners borrowed Rs. 40,000 from the guru (ancestor) of the decree holder under mortgage bond, dated 11 1 1893."
FACTS,"Out of Rs. 40,370 7 6 interest and compound interest up to 4 1 1910, Rs. 32,370 7 6 was paid in cash and for the balance Rs. 8,000 interest and Rs. 40,000 principal, i,e., for Rs, 48,000 a Mortgage Suit No. 14 of 1910 was filed in1st Court of the Sub Judge, Patna, and in lieu of the claim and cost of the said suit two fresh mortgage bonds were executed on 11 7 1910, viz., one for Rs. 40,000 and the other for Rs. 9,488 and the latter bond was satisfied by payment of Rs. 15,835 in cash."
FACTS,"With respect to the above bond of Rs. 40,000, dated 11 7 1910 the petitioners paid Rs. 38,530 13 6."
FACTS,"Mort , gage Suit No. 110 of 1927 was brought in the 3rd Court of the Sub Judge, Patna, and a decree for Rs. 58,012 2.0 was passed on 9 7 1929."
FACTS,"Out of this Rs. 5,000 was paid in cash and for the balance of Rs. 53,012 12 0 one mortgage bond dated 6 10 1931 was executed for Rs. 42,000 and on the same date two 140 hand notes were executed, viz., one for Rs. 5,000 and one for Rs. 6012 2 0."
FACTS,"One Suit No. 14 of 1933 for both the hand notes was brought in 3rd Court of the Sub Judge and a decree for Rs. 15,008 2 0 was passed on 28 2 1935."
FACTS,This decree is under execution.
FACTS,""" When the decree holder sought to execute the money decree by attachment and sale of the judgmentdebtors ' properties stating that they were subject to a mortgage lien of Rs. 62,272 13 0 under the mortgage bond dated 6 10 1931, the two judgment debtors, who are brothers, filed objec tions under sections 11 and 16 of the earlier Bihar Money lenders Act III of 1938 and section 47 of the Civil Procedure Code."
FACTS,The petitions (two by each of them) were filed separately by the brothers.
FACTS,"They urged that on a proper calculation under section 11 no lien was subsisting on the properties owing to payments made towards the mort gage debt amounting to Rs. 92,394 2 0."
RLC,The Subordinate Judge held that this plea of the judgment debtors could not be entertained in the Miscellaneous case before him relating to the execution and all that could be done was to notify the mortgage encumbrance without deciding anything as to the correctness of the amount claimed to be due under it; and this conclusion was partly based on the fact that section 16 of the Act had been declared by the High Court void.
RLC,Ap peals taken to the High Court were dismissed.
STATUTE,"The judgment debtors thereupon preferred an appeal to the Feder al Court, contending that sections 7 and 13 of the new Act (corresponding to sections 7 and 11 of the old Act)were applicable and that it was the duty of the court to estimate the value of the property after making the necessary calcu lations under section 7 with reference to the lien."
PRECEDENT,The decision of the Federal Court is reported in Ramnandan Prasad Narain Singh and Another vs Kulpati Shri Mahanth Goshwarni Madhwanand Ramji(1).
FACTS,"The case was remitted back to the High (1) 141 Court, giving liberty to the appellants to file an applica tion under section 13."
FACTS,"In answer to a fresh application for execution dated 2 7 1042, the two brothers filed the same objections as before."
FACTS,Miscellaneous Cases Nos. 45 and 46 of 1942 related to sections 7 and 13 of the Bihar Money lenders Act and Miscellaneous Cases Nos. 50 and 52 of 1042 related to the objections under section 47 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
RLC,"The Subordinate Judge held that the amount of the loan should be taken as the amount mentioned in the mortgage deed of 1931 and not the amount advanced in 1893 and that a sum of Rs. 70,840 was still due on the bond."
RLC,"He determined the market value of the several properties given as security, adopting 16 times the net income as the basis."
RLC,Appeals to the High Court were numbered as M.A. 108 to 111 of 1943 and they were heard by Manohar Lall and Imam JJ.
RLC,They modified the order of the lower Court in certain re spects.
REASONING,"Even according to them the amount of the loan was what was mentioned in the mortgage bond of 6 10 1931, but as a sum of Rs. 11,855 3 0 had been repaid expressly towards the principal amount after the date of the bond, that amount became reduced to Rs. 28,150."
REASONING,"Adding an equal sum by way of interest which according to them was the maximum amount, permitted to be allowed under section 7 of the Act, the total liability was stated to be Rs. 56,300 and a charge was declared on the property for this amount."
REASONING,They also directed that the valuation of the property should be fixed at twenty times the net income and not sixteen times.
REASONING,It is from this order that the present appeals have been preferred.
REASONING,"Two points were urged on behalf of the appellants, namely (a) that the decree holder was barred by construc tive res judicata from contending that the construction placed upon section 7 by the judgmentdebtors was wrong; and (b) that in applying section 7, we must consider the origi nal amount of loan of Rs. 40,000 given in the year 1893 and allow the claim 142 of interest only for that maximum sum, after taking into account all sums paid by the appellants and their predeces sors towards interest since 1893."
REASONING,The first point is entirely without substance.
REASONING,"When the decree holder contended that section 11 of the Bihar Money lenders Act, 1938, was declared void and ultra vires and that therefore section 7 of the new Act which corresponded to section 11 was also inapplicable, the judgment debtors pleaded that they were entitled to the benefit of section 7 of the new Act."
PRECEDENT,The Federal Court held in Ramnandan Prasad Narain Singh and Another vs Kulpati Shri Mahanth Goshwami Madhwanand Ramji(1) that the judgment debtors (present appellants) were entitled to claim the benefit of the provi sions of the new Act when the executing court proceeded under section 13 to determine the value of the properties to be sold.
STATUTE,The correct interpretation of section 7 was not in question between the parties.
STATUTE,To say that the appellants were entitled to take advantage of the provisions of section 7 is entirely different from the contention that the inter pretation sought to be put by them on section 7 was the right one.
,The Federal Court was not dealing with any question of interpretation at all.
REASONING,"It is impossible to see where the doctrine of constructive res judicata comes in, so as to be of help to the appellants."
REASONING,"The second question raised on their behalf relates to the true meaning of section 7 of the Bihar Moneylenders (Regulation of Transactions) Act VII of 1939, which is in these terms: ""7."
REASONING,"Notwithstanding anything to the contrary con tained in any other law or in anything having the force of law or in any agreement, no Court shall, in any suit brought by a money lender before or after the commencement of this Act in respect of a loan advanced before or after the com mencement of this Act or in any appeal or proceedings in revision arising out of such suit, pass a decree for an amount of interest for the period preceding the institution of the suit, (1) 143 which together with any amount already realised as interest through the court or otherwise, is greater than the amount of loan advanced, or, if the loan is based on a document, the amount of loan mentioned in, or evidenced by, such document."
REASONING,""" In the present case, the original loan of Rs. 40,000 was advanced as early as 11 1 1893."
REASONING,"The appellants j contend that for the purposes of calculating the interest to be decreed prior to the date of the suit the loan advanced must be taken to be the original sum and that if an account is taken of all the sums received by the creditor as interest from that date up to the date of the suit, there would be nothing due for interest."
REASONING,"On the other hand, the decree holder urges that having regard to the latter part of the section, the loan must be taken to be the amount mentioned in the mortgage bond dated 8 10 1931, namely Rs. 42,000."
REASONING,"Whichever method of calculation is adopted, it must be remembered that it has to be made not for the purposes of passing any decree on the mortgage loan, but for estimating under section 13 of the Act the value of the properties to be brought to sale in execution of the money decree against the appellants."
PRECEDENT,"As pointed out by Sir Maurice Gwyer C.J. in Surendra Prasad Narain Singh vs Sri Gajadhar Prasad Sahu Trust Estate and Otherse), ""Section 7 of the Act of 1937 is no doubt extremely obscure and illdrawn."
REASONING,""" The true intention of the framers of the Act is somewhat difficult to gather."
RLC,But the Patna High Court has been consistently placing upon the section an interpretation which is opposed to the contention of the appellant in these proceedings.
PRECEDENT,"The point came up expressly for decision in Singhesh war Singh and Others vs Madni Prasad Singh Others(2) where a mortgage bond was executed on 31 8 1922 for a sum of Rs. 2,000 which was the balance of the principal and inter est due under a mortgage bond of the 11th of October, 1912, for (1) (2)A.T.R. 1940 Pat."
,"65. 19 144 Rs. 1,391."
REASONING,"The judgment debtors raised the plea that the court should go back to the earlier bond of 1912 and that as a sum of Rs. 1,512 had been paid as and by way of interest towards that bond, no decree could be passed against them for more than the principal sum of Rs. 1,391."
REASONING,"The learned Judges rejected this contention and took the amount stated in the document of 1922, namely Rs. 2,000, as the loan and they held that the plaintiffs were entitled to get a decree for interest for a sum not larger than Rs. 2,000 as no payment had been proved to have been made after the execution of the bond."
REASONING,"The same view was taken in Lal Singh vs Ramnarain Ram and Others(1) and the plain tiffs were awarded a decree on the basis that the loan was to be taken as Rs. 2,909 8 0 which was the amount for which the hand note sued upon was executed and not Rs. 1,000 which was the original amount advanced upon an earlier hand note of the year 1924."
REASONING,The case reported in Madho Prasad Singh vs Mukutdhari Singh and Others(2) lays down the same position.
REASONING,"The Full Bench decision in Deo Nandan Prasad vs Ram Prasad (3) rei terates the same view, pointing out the distinction between sections 7 and 8 of the Act and stating that while under section 8 we can go to the original loan in spite of a later document, under section 7, the loan must relate to the document on which the suit is based, that is, the final document and not the original one."
REASONING,"In each one of these cases, the question of the true meaning of section 7 was pointedly considered."
REASONING,This construction no doubt enables a creditor to circumvent the beneficent provisions of the Act by taking a document for the interest due and adding it to the principal amount.
PRECEDENT,Gwyer C.J. points out this difficulty at page 59 in the case Surendra Prasad Narain Singh vs Sri Gajadhar Prasad Sahu Trust Estate and Others(4).
REASONING,"If the interpretation does not carry out the intentions of the framers of the Act by reason of unhappy or ambiguous phrasing, it is for the Legis lature to intervene."
,"But far from doing so, it has (1) , Patna 618."
,(2) (1941) 193 I.C.661.
,(4) [1940] F.C.R.39.
REASONING,"145 acquiesced, during all these years in the construction which the Patna High Court has been placing upon the section from the very next year after the enactment of the statute."
REASONING,"Having regard to the great obscurity in the language em ployed in the relevant provisions and the inaction of the Legislature, it is, in our opinion, legitimate to infer that the view expressed by the Patna High Court is in accord with the intention of the Legislature."
,"The appeals fail and are dismissed with costs, only one set in all of them together."
RLC,Appeals dismissed.

REASONING,"773 The position, therefore, is that to convey an absolute estate to a Hindu female, no express power of alienation need be given; it is enough if words are used of such ampli tude as would convey full rights of ownership."
REASONING,Mr. Banerjee naturally lays stress upon the description of the document as 'Tamliknama ' and the use of the word ' Malik ' or owner in reference to the interest which it pur ports to convey to the transferee.
REASONING,The word ' Malik ' is of very common use in many parts of India and it cannot cer tainly be regarded as a technical term of conveyancing.
REASONING,"In the language of the Privy Council, the term 'Malik ' when used in a will or other document ""as descriptive of the position which a devisee or donee is intended to hold, has been held apt to describe an owner possessed of full pro prietory rights, including a full right of alienation, unless there is something in the context or in the surround ing circumstances to indicate that such full proprietory rights were not intended to be conferred(1). ' ' This I think to be a perfectly correct statement of law and I only desire to add that it should be taken with the caution which the Judicial Committee uttered in course of the same observa tion that ""the meaning of every word in an Indian document must always depend upon the setting in which it is placed, the subject to which it is related and the locality of the grantor from which it receives its true shade of meaning."
ISSUE,""" The question before us, therefore, narrows down to this as to whether in the present case there is anything in the context of these two connected instruments or in the sur rounding circumstances to cut down the full proprietory rights that the word 'Malik ' ordinarily imports."
RLC,The High Court in reaching its decision adverse to the appellant laid great stress on the fact that the grant was expressed to be for maintenance and residence of Mst.
,Meria.
REASONING,"This, it is said, would prima facie indicate that the grant was to enure for the lifetime of the grantee."
PRECEDENT,"It is pointed out by the learned (1) Vide Sasiman Chowdhurain vs Shib Narayan, 49 I.A, 25."
REASONING,99 774 Judges that the language of the document does not show that anybody else besides the lady herself was to be benefited by the grant and the indemnity given by Babu Ram was also given to the lady personally.
REASONING,"It is further said that if Meria was given an absolute estate in the properties comprised in the 'Tamliknama ', there was no necessity for including these two properties again in the deed of relinquishment which she executed at the same time."
REASONING,"I do not think that the mere fact that the gift of property is made for the support and maintenance of a female relation could be taken to be a prima facie indication of the intention of the donor, that the donee was to enjoy the property only during her life time."
REASONING,"The extent of interest, which the donee is to take, depends upon the intention of the donor as expressed by the language use, d, and if the dispositive words employed in the document are clear and unambiguous and import absolute ownership, the purpose of the grant would not, by itself, restrict or cut down the interest."
REASONING,"The desire to provide maintenance or residence of the donee would only show the motive which prompted the donor to make the gift, but it could not be read as a meas ure of the extent of the gift."
PRECEDENT,This was laid down in clear terms by the Judicial Committee in a comparatively recent case which is to be found reported in Bishunath Prasad vs Chandrika(1).
REASONING,"There a Hindu executed a registered deed of gift of certain properties in favour of his daughter in law for the"" support and maintenance"" of his daughter in law and declared that the donee should remain absolute owner of the property (malik mustaqil) and pay Government revenue."
REASONING,There were no words in the document expressly making the interest heritable or conferring on the donee the power of making alienation.
REASONING,"It was held by the Judicial Committee that the donee took under the document, an absolute estate with powers to make alienation giving title valid after her death."
REASONING,"In course of the judgment, Lord Blanesburgh quoted, with approval, an earlier decision of the (1) 60 I.A 56 775 Judicial Committee, where the words ""for your maintenance"" occurring in a deed of gift were held insufficient to cut down to life interest the estate taken by the donees."
REASONING,"These words, it was said, ""are quite capable of signifying that the gift was made for the purpose of enabling them to live in comfort and do not necessarily mean that it was to be limited to a bare right of maintenance."
PRECEDENT,""" On behalf of the respondent, reliance was placed upon the decision of the Judicial Committee in Raja Ram Buksh vs Arjun(1)in support of the contention that in a maintenance grant it is the prima facie intention of the gift that it should be for life."
REASONING,"In my opinion, the decision cited is no authority for the general proposition as is contended for by the learned Counsel for the respondent, and it is to be read in the context of the actual facts of the case which relate to grants of a particular type with special features of its own."
REASONING,It was a case where a Talukdar made a grant of certain villages to a junior member of the joint family for mainte nance of the latter.
REASONING,The family was governed by the law of primegeniture and the estate descended to a single heir.
REASONING,"In such cases the usual custom is that the junior members of the family, who can get no share in the property, are enti tled to provisions by way of maintenance for which assign ments of lands are generally made in their favour."
REASONING,"The extent of interest taken by the grantee in the assigned lands depends entirely upon the circumstances of the partic ular case, or rather upon the usage that prevails in the particular family."
REASONING,In the case before the Privy Council there was actually no deed of transfer.
REASONING,"It was an oral assignment made by the Talukdar, and the nature of the grant had to be determined upon the recitals of a petition for mutation of names made to the Revenue Department by the grantor after the verbal assignment was made and from other facts and circumstances of the case."
PRECEDENT,"The case of Woodoya ditta Deb vs Mukoond(2), which was referred to and relied upon in the judgment of the Privy Council, was (1) 28 I.A, 1."
,(2) 22 w.
,R. 229.
REASONING,"776 also a case of maintenance or khor phos grant made in favour of a junior member of the family, where theestate was im partible and descended under the rules of primogeniture."
REASONING,"It was held in that case that such grants, the object of which was to make suitable provisions for the immediate members of the family, were by their very nature and also under the custom of the land resumable by the zemindar on the death of the grantee, as otherwise the whole zemindary would be swallowed up by continual demands."
REASONING,"This principle bas obviously no application to cases of the type which we have before us and it was never so applied by the Privy Council, as would appear from the decision referred to above."
REASONING,"The learned Counsel for the plaintiff respondent drew our attention in this connection, to the fact that the properties given by the ,Tamliknama ' were valued at Rs. 8,000, whereas the entire estate left by Mangal Sen was worth Rs. 25,000 only."
REASONING,"It is argued that the transfer of nearly one third of the entire estate in absolute right to one who was entitled to maintenance merely, is, on the face of it, against probability and common sense."
REASONING,"I do not think that, on the facts of this case, any weight could be at tached to this argument."
REASONING,"In the first place, it is to be noted that whatever might have been the actual market value of the properties, what the widow got under the Tamliknama was a residential house and a shop, and the shop was the only property which fetched any income."
REASONING,"This shop, it appears, was all along in possession of Sunder Lal, the brother of Meria, and the rent, which he paid or promised to pay in respect of the same, was only Rs. 12 a month."
REASONING,"So from the income of this property it was hardly possible for Meria to have even abate maintenance, and this would rather support the inference that the properties were given to her absolutely and not for enjoyment merely, so long as she lived."
REASONING,"But what is more important is, that the object of creating these two documents, as the surrounding circumstances show, was not merely to make provision 777 for the maintenance of Mst."
REASONING,Meria; the other and the more important object was to perfect the title of Nand Lal to the estate left by Mangal Sen and to quiet all disputes that freight arise in respect of the same.
REASONING,It may be that Mst.
REASONING,"Meria could not, in law, claim any."
REASONING,thing more than a right to be maintained out of the estate of her deceased father in law.
REASONING,"But it is clear that whatever her legal rights might have been, Nand Lal 's own position as the sole owner of the properties left by Mangal Sen was not altogeth er undisputed or free from any hostile attack."
REASONING,"As has been said already, Sunder Lal, the brother of Meria, was in occupation of the double storied shop from long before the Tamliknama was executed and Meria got any legal title to it."
REASONING,It appears from the record that in 1920 a suit was institut ed on behalf of the infant Nand Lal for evicting Sunder Lal from the shop and the allegation in the plaint was that Sunder Lal was occupying the property as a tenant since the time of Mst.
REASONING,Mithani by taking a settlement from her.
REASONING,Sunder Lal in his written statement filed in that suit expressly repudiated the allegation of tenancy and also the title of Nand Lal and openly asserted that it was Mst.
REASONING,Meria who was the actual owner of Mangal Sen 's estate.
REASONING,"The suit ended in a compromise arrived at through the medium of arbitrators and the result was that although Sunder Lal admitted the title of the plaintiff, the latter had to abandon the claims which were made in the plaint for rents, costs and damages."
REASONING,Sunder Lal continued to be in occupation of the shop and executed a rent agreement in respect of the same in favour of Nand Lal promising to pay a rent of Rs. 12 per month.
REASONING,"A few months later, the Tamliknama was executed and this shop along with the residential house were given to Meria in maliki right."
REASONING,"The recitals in both the Tamliknama and the deed of relin quishment clearly indicate that the supreme anxiety on the part of Babu Ram, who was trying his best to safeguard the interests of the minor, was to put an end to all further disputes that might be raised by or on behalf of Mst."
REASONING,Meria with regard to the rights of Nand Lal to the properties 778 of Mangal Sen and to make his title to the same absolutely impeccable.
REASONING,That seems to be the reason why Meria was given a comparatively large portion of the properties left by Mangal Sen which would enable her to live in comfort and her interest was not limited to a bare right of mainte nance.
REASONING,"It is significant to note that the shop room, which was all along in possession of Sunder Lal, was included in this Tamliknama and soon after the grant was made, Sunder Lal executed a rent agreement in respect of the shop in favour of Mst."
REASONING,Meria acknowledging her to be the owner of the property.
REASONING,"It is true that the document does not make any reference to the heirs of Meria, but that is not at all necessary, nor is it essential that any express power of alienation should be given."
REASONING,"The word ""Malik"" is too common an expres sion in this part of the country and its meaning and impli cations were fairly well settled by judicial pronouncements long before the document was executed."
REASONING,"If really the grantee was intended to have only a life interest in the properties, there was no lack of appropriate words, per fectly well known in the locality, to express such inten tion."
REASONING,The High Court seems to have been influenced to some extent by the fact that in the Tamliknama there was a guarantee given by Babu Ram to Meria herself and to no one else agreeing to compensate her in case she was dispossessed from the properties at the instance of Nand Lal.
REASONING,This covenant in the document was in the nature of a personal guarantee given by Babu Ram to Mst.
REASONING,Meria for the simple reason that the property belonged to an infant and it was as guardian of the minor that Babu Ram was purporting to act.
REASONING,It was too much to expect that Babu Ram would bind himself for all time to come and give a guarantee to the future heirs of Meria as well.
REASONING,Probably no such thing was contem plated by the parties and no such undertaking was insisted upon by the other side.
REASONING,"But whatever the reason might be which led to the covenant being expressed in this particu lar form, I do not think that it has even a remote bearing on the 779 question that arises for our consideration in the present case."
REASONING,"It is of no assistance to the plaintiff in support of the construction that is sought to be put upon the , docu ment on his behalf."
REASONING,"I am also not at all impressed by the other fact re ferred to in the judgment of the High Court that if the properties were given to Meria in absolute right, there was no necessity for including them again in the schedule to the deed of relinquishment which Meria executed."
REASONING,I fail to see how the inclusion of the properties in the deed of relin quishment would go to indicate that Meria 's rights to these properties were of a restricted and not an absolute charac ter.
REASONING,It is after all a pure matter of conveyancing and the two documents have to be read together as parts of one and the same ' transaction.
REASONING,"Under the ' Tamliknama ', Meria got two properties in absolute right out of the estate of Mangal Sen."
REASONING,"By the deed of relinquishment, she renounced her claim for maintenance in respect of all the properties left by Mangal Sen including the two items which she got under the 'Tamliknama '."
REASONING,"After the ' Tamliknama ' was executed in her favour, there Was no further question of her claiming any right of maintenance in respect of these two items of property."
REASONING,She became the absolute owner thereof in exchange of her rights of maintenance over the entire estate and this right of maintenance she gave up by the deed of relinquish ment.
REASONING,"On a construction of the entire document, my conclu sion is that there is nothing in the context of the docu ment, or in the surrounding circumstances which would dis place the presumption of full proprietory rights which the use of the word ""Malik"" is apt ordinarily to convey."
REASONING,"The first contention of the appellant, therefore, succeeds and in view of my decision on this point, the second question does not arise for determination at all."
RPC,"The result is that the appeal is allowed, the judgment and decree of the High Court are set aside and those of the trial Judge restored."
RPC,The defendant No. 6 will have his costs from the plaintiff in all the courts.
RPC,There will be no order for costs as regards the other parties: 780 FAZL ALI J.
RPC,"I agree with the judgment delivered by my learned brother, Mukherjea J. CHANDRASEKHARA AIYAR J."
RPC,During the hearing of the appeal I entertained doubts whether the view taken by the High Court was not correct.
RPC,"But on further consideration, I find that it cannot be maintained, having regard to the terms of the ' Tamliknama ' (deed of transfer) in favour of Musammat Meria and the context in which it came into exist ence."
RPC,The name of the document or deed does not very much matter.
RPC,"Though the word ' malik ' is not a term of art, it has been held in quite a large number of cases, decided mostly by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, that the word, as employed in Indian documents, means absolute owner and that unless the context indicated a different meaning, its use would be sufficient to convey a full title even without the addition of the words, ' heirs ', or ' son ', ' grandson ' and ' great grandson '."
RPC,"Of course, if there are other clauses in the document which control the import of the word and restrict the estate to a limited one, we must give the narrower meaning; otherwise the word must receive its full significance."
PRECEDENT,"Especially is this so, when the rule of interpretation laid down in Mohammed Shamsul vs Sewak Ram( ') has come to be regarded as unsound."
PRECEDENT,The language employed in the ' Tamliknama ' (exhibit II) is almost similar to the language of the deeds construed in Bhaidas Shivdas vs Bai Gulab & Another( '2) and Bishunath Prasad Singh vs Chandika Prasad Kumari and Others(s) where it was held that an absolute estate was conveyed.
RPC,I agree that the judgment and decree of the High Court should be set aside and that the decree of the trial Judge should be restored with costs to the appellant in all the Courts.
RPC,Appeal allowed.
