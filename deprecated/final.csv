CITATION,"Equivalent citations: 1950 AIR 165, 1950 SCR 553 "
CITATION,Appeal No. LXVI of 1949. 
STATUTE,"Appeal from the High Court of judicature, Bombay, in a reference under section 66 of the Indian Income tax Act, 1022. "
COUNSEL,"K.M. Munshi (N. P. Nathvani, with him), for the appel lant. ' M.C. Setalvad, Attorney General for India (H. J. Umrigar, with him), for the respondent. 1950."
JUDGE,The judgment of the Court was delivered by MEHR CHAND MAHAJAN J.
RLC,This is an appeal against a judgment of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay in an income tax matter and it raises the question whether munici pal property tax and urban immoveable property tax payable under the relevant Bombay Acts are allowable deductions under section 9 (1) (iv) of the Indian Income tax Act. 
FACTS,The assessee company is an investment company deriving its income from properties in the city of Bombay. 
FACTS,"For the assessment year 1940 41 the net income of the assessee under the head ""property"" was computed by the Income tax Officer in the sum of Rs. 6,21,764 after deducting from gross rents certain payments.  "
FACTS,"The company had paid during the relevant year Rs. 1,22,675 as municipal property tax and Rs. 32,760 as urban property tax."
STATUTE,Deduction of these two sums was claimed under the provisions of section 9 the Act.
RLC,"Out of the first item a deduction in the sum of Rs. 48,572 was allowed on the ground that this item represented tenants ' burdens paid by the assessee, otherwise the claim was disallowed"
FACTS,The appeals of the assessee to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and to the Income tax Appellate Tribunal were unsuccessful. 
RLC,The High Court answered all the three questions in the negative and hence this appeal.
STATUTE,"The decision of the point depends firstly on the construction of the language employed in sub clause (iv) of sub section (1) of section 9 of the Act, and secondly, on a finding as to the true nature and character of the liability of the owner under the relevant Bombay Acts for the payment of these taxes. "
STATUTE,"Before the amending Act of 1939, clause (iv) contained only the first, third and fourth sub clauses. "
REASONING,Under the first sub clause interest is deductible whether the amount borrowed on the security of the property was spent on the property or not. 
REASONING,There is no question of any capital or other expenditure on the property. 
REASONING,"The expression ""capital charge"" in the sub clause cannot connote a charge on the capital, that is, the property assessed. "
REASONING,That would be a redundancy as the opening words themselves clearly indicate that the charge is on the property.
RPC,"We are therefore of opinion that capital charge here could only mean a charge created for a capital sum, i.e., a charge to secure the discharge of a liability of a capital nature. "
PRECEDENT,In 1933 the Privy Council decided the case of Bijoy Singh. 
PRECEDENT,"Dudhuria vs Commissioner of Income tax, Calcutta (1 ). "
PRECEDENT,It was not an assessment under section 9 but an assessment on the general income of an assessee who was liable to pay maintenance for his step mother which had been charged on all his assets by a decree of Court. 
PRECEDENT,It was not a liability voluntarily incurred by him but one cast on him by law.
PRECEDENT,The Privy Council held that the amount paid by him in discharge of that liability formed no part of his real income and so should not be included in his assessment. 
PRECEDENT,"Though the decision proceeded on the principle that the outgoings were not part of the assessee 's income at all, the framers of the amending Act of 1939 wanted, apparently, to extend the principle, so far as the assessment of property was concerned, even to cases where obligatory payments had to be made out of the assessee 's income from the property charged with such payments, and the second sub clause, namely, ""where the property is subject to an annual charge not being a capital charge, the amount of such charge"" was added. "
ARG,It is this sub clause which the appellant invokes in support of its claim to deduction of the municipal and urban property taxes in the present case. 
REASONING,"In view of the opening words of the newly added sub clause, the expression ""capital charge"" also used therein cannot have reference to a charge on the property, and we think it must (1) I.L.R. 60 cal."
REASONING,"557 be understood in the same sense as in sub clause (1); that is to say, the first sub clause having provided for deduc tion of interest where a capital sum is charged on the property, this sub clause provides for a deduction of annual sums so charged, such sums not being capital sums, the limiting words being intended to exclude cases where capital raised on the security of the property is made repayable in instalments. "
PRECEDENT,"In Commissioner of Income tax, Bombay vs Mahomedbhoy Rowji (1), a Bench of the Bombay High Court considered the meaning of these words. "
PRECEDENT,"It is therefore clear that there is no conflict of judicial deci sions as to the meaning of the phrase ""annual charge"" occur ring in section 3 (1) (iv) and the meaning given is the natural meaning of these words."
PRECEDENT,"As to the phrase ""capital charge"", Beaumont C.J. in the case above referred to took the view that the words mean a charge on capital. "
PRECEDENT,"Kania J., however, took a different view and observed that he was not prepared to accept the sugges tion that a document which provides for a certain payment to be made monthly or annually and charged on immoveable property or the estate of an individual becomes a capital charge."
PRECEDENT,In the Allahabad judgment under appeal these (1) I.L.R. (2) I.L.R. 1944 All.
PRECEDENT,558 words were considered as not meaning a charge on capital. 
PRECEDENT,"It was said that if an annual charge means a charge to secure the discharge of an annual liability, then, capital charge means a charge to secure the discharge of a liability of a capital nature. "
RPC,We think this construction is a natu ral construction of the section and is right. 
RPC,"The determination of the point whether the taxes in dispute fall within the ambit of the phrase ""annual charge not being a capital charge"" depends on the provisions of the statutes under which they are levied."
STATUTE,"Section 143 of the City of Bombay Municipal Act, 1888, authorises the levy of a general tax on all buildings and lands in the city. "
STATUTE,The primary responsibility to pay this property tax is on the lessor (vide section 146 of the Act). 
STATUTE,In order to assess the tax provision has been made for the determination of the annual rateable value of the building in section 154. 
STATUTE,"Section 156 provides for the maintenance of an assessment book in which entries have to be made every official year of all buildings in the city, their rateable value, the names of persons primarily liable for payment of the property tax on such buildings and of the amount for which each building has been assessed."
STATUTE,These sections lay down a procedure for hearing objections and complaints against entries in the assessment book. 
REASONING,From these provisions it is clear that the liability for the tax is determined at the beginning of each official year and the tax is an annual one.
STATUTE,"Sections 143to 168 concern themselves with the imposition, liability and assessment of the tax for the year."
STATUTE,""" Section 197 provides that each of the property taxes shall be payable in 559 advance in half yearly instalments on each first day of April and each first day of October. "
STATUTE,"Finally section 212 provides as follows : ""Property taxes due under this Act in respect of any building or land shall, subject to the prior payment of the land revenue, if any, due to the provincial ,Government thereupon, be a first charge . . upon the said build ing or land . "" It creates a statutory charge on the building. "
STATUTE,"Urban immove able property tax is leviable under section 22 of Part VI of the Bombay Finance Act, 1932,on the annual letting value of the property. "
STATUTE,Section 24 (2) (b) is in terms similar to section 212 of the Bombay Municipal Act. 
STATUTE,"For the purposes of section 9 of the Indian Income tax Act both these taxes, namely, the munici pal property tax as well as the urban immoveable property tax are of the same character and stand on the same footing."
ARG,"Mr. Munshi, the learned counsel for the appellant con tended that both the taxes are assessed on the annual value of the land or the building and are annual taxes, although it may be that they are collected at intervals of six months for the sake of convenience, that the income tax itself is assessed on an annual basis, that in allowing deductions all payments made or all liabilities incurred during the previ ous year of assessment should be allowed and that the taxes in question fell clearly within the language of section 9 (1) (iv). "
ARG,"The learned Attorney General, on the other hand, argued that although the taxes are assessed for the year the liability to pay them arises at the beginning 560 of each half year and unless a notice of demand is issued and a bill presented there is no liability to pay them and that till then no charge under section 212 of the Act could possibly arise and that the liability to pay being half yearly in advance, the charge is not an annual charge. "
ARG,It was also suggested that the taxes were a capital charge in the sense of the property being security for the payment. 
REASONING,The annual liability can be discharged by half yearly instalments. 
REASONING,"The liability being an annual one and the property having been subjected to it, the provisions of clause (iv) of subsection (1) of section 9 are immediately attracted. "
REASONING,"Great emphasis was laid on the word""due"" used in section 212 of the Municipal Act and it was said that as the taxes do not become due under the Act unless the time for the payment arrives, no charge comes into existence till then and that the charge is not an annual charge."
REASONING,We do not think that this is a correct construction of section 212.
REASONING,"The words ""property taxes due under this Act"" mean property taxes for which a person is liable under the Act. "
REASONING,Taxes payable during the year have been made a charge on the property. 
REASONING,The liability and the charge both co-exist and are co extensive.
REASONING,The provisions of the Act affording facilities for the discharge of the liability do not in any way affect their true nature and character. 
REASONING,"If the annual liability is not discharged in the manner laid down by section 197, can it be said that the property cannot be sold for recovery of the whole amount due for the year ? The answer to this query can only be in the affirmative, i.e., that the property is liable to sale."
PRECEDENT,"In Commissioner of Income tax, Bombay vs Mahomedbhoy Rowji(1) Beaumont C.J., while rejecting the claim for the deduction of the taxes, placed reliance on (1) I.L.R. 561 section 9 (1) (v) which allows a deduction in respect of any sums paid on account of land revenue. "
PRECEDENT,It was observed that land revenue stands on the same footing as municipal taxes and that as the legislature made a special provision for deduction of sums payable in regard to land revenue but not in respect of sums paid on account of municipal taxes that circumstance indicated that the deduction was not allowable. 
PRECEDENT,"For the same purpose reference was also made to the provi sions of section 10 which deal with business allowances and wherein deduction of any sum paid on account of land reve nue, local rates or municipal taxes has been allowed."
PRECEDENT,In the concluding part of his judgment the learned Chief Jus tice said that it was not necessary for him to consider what the exact meaning of the words was and that it was suffi cient for him to say that it did not cover municipal taxes which are made a charge on the property under section 212 of the Bombay Municipal Act. 
REASONING,Without determining the exact meaning of the words used by the statute it seems to us it was not possible to arrive at the conclusion that the taxes were not within the ambit of the clause. 
REASONING,It is elementary that the primary duty of a Court is to give effect to the intention of the legislature as expressed in the words used by it and no outside consideration can be called in aid tO find that intention.  
REASONING,"Again reference to clause (v) of the section is not very helpful because land revenue is a charge of a paramount nature on all buildings and lands and that being so, a deduction in respect of the amount was mentioned in express terms.  "
REASONING,The law as to them varies from province to province and they may not be necessarily a charge on property in all cases. 
REASONING,"The legislature seems to have thought that so far as municipal taxes on property are concerned, if they fall within the ambit of clause (iv), deduction will be claimable in respect of them but not otherwise. "
REASONING,"562 Kania J. in the above case in arriving at his conclusion was influenced by the consideration that these taxes were of a variable character, i.e., liable to be increased or reduced under the various provisions of the Municipal Act and that the charge was in the nature of a contingent charge."
REASONING,"With great respect, it may be pointed out that all charges in a way may be or are of a variable and contingent nature. "
REASONING,"If no default is made, no charge is ever enforceable and whenever there is a charge, it can be increased or reduced during the year either by payment or by additional borrowing."
PRECEDENT,"In Moss Empires Ltd. vs Inland Revenue Commissioners (1) it was held by the House of Lords that the fact that certain payments were contingent and variable in amount did not affect their character of being annual payments and that the word, ""annual"" must be taken to have the quality of being recurrent or being capable of recurrence. "
PRECEDENT,"In Cunard 's Trustees vs Inland Revenue Commissioners (2) it was held that the payments were capable of being recur rent and were therefore annual payments within the meaning of schedule D, case III, rule 1 (1), even though they were not necessarily recurrent year by year and the fact that they varied in amount was immaterial. "
RPC,The Allahabad High Court (1) (2) [1948] 1 A.E.R. 150. (3) I.L.R. (4) I.L.R. 563 in Gappumal Kanhaiya Lal vs Commissioner of Incometax (1) (the connected appeal) took a correct view of this matter and the reasoning given therein has our approval. -
RPC,The result is that this appeal is allowed and the two questions which were referred to the High Court by the Income tax Tribunal and cited above are answered in the affirmative. 
RPC,The appellants will have their costs in the appeal.
RPC,Appeal allowed.

COUNSEL,"S.P. Sinha (P. K. Bose, with him) for the appel lant."
COUNSEL,"N.C. Chatterjee and Panchanan Ghosh (Chandra Narayan Naik, with them) for the respondent. 1950."
JUDGE,The Judgment of the Court was deliv ered by PATANJALI SASTRI J.
FACTS,"This appeal arises out of a suit brought by the respondent in the court of the Subordinate Judge, Dhanbad, for recovery of arrears of royalty and cess from the appellant and another alleged to be due under a compromise decree passed on the 6th March, 1923, in a previ ous suit between the predecessors in interest of the par ties."
FACTS,The only plea which is material for the purpose of this appeal is that the compromise decree not having been registered was inadmissible in evidence.
FACTS,The courts below held that the document did not require registration and gave effect to its terms in decreeing the suit.
FACTS,The second defendant has preferred this appeal.
FACTS,The facts are not now in dispute and may be briefly stated.
FACTS,"On 11th March, 1921, one Kumar Krishna Prasad Singh (hereinafter referred to as Kumar) granted a perma nent lease of the right to the underground coal in 5,800 bighas of land belonging to him to Shibsaran Singh and Sitaram Singh (hereinafter referred to as the Singhs) by a registered patta stipulating for a salami of Rs. 8,000 and royalty at the rate of 2a."
FACTS,"per ton of coal raised subject to a minimum of Rs. 8,000 and for certain other cesses and interest."
FACTS,"On 7th June, 1921, Kumar executed another perma nent patta leasing the right to the coal in 500 bighas out of the 5,800 bighas referred to above to one Prayngji Bal lavji Deoshi and his son Harakchand Deoshi (hereinafter referred to as the Deoshis)."
FACTS,By this document.
FACTS,835 the Deoshis agreed inter alia to pay royalty at the rate of 2a. per ton on all classes of coal raised subject to a minimum of Rs. 750 a year.
FACTS,"The Singhs feeling themselves aggrieved by the latter transaction brought a title suit (No. 1291 of 1921) in the Court of the Subordinate Judge of Dhanbad for a declaration of their title and for possession of the 500 bighas leased to the Deoshis under the aforesaid patta of 7th June, 1921."
FACTS,"To that suit Kumar was made a party as defendant No. 3, the Deoshis being defendants 1 and 2."
FACTS,"The suit was however cornpromised on 6th March, 1923, by all the parties and a decree based on the compromise was also passed on the same day."
FACTS,"The interest of the Singhs was brought to sale in 193S in execution of a decree obtained against them and was purchased by the plaintiff who insti tuted the presnt suit on 3rd October, 1942, claiming the royalty and cesses payable under the compromise decree for the period from Pous 1345 to Asadh 1349 B.S. from defendants 1 and 2 as the representatives of the Deoshis who entered into the compromise of March, 1923."
FACTS,"In order to appreciate the contentions of the parties, it is necessary to set out the relevant terms of the compro mise decree which are as follows : ""The plaintiffs (the Singhs) within two months from this date shall pay Rs. 8,000 as salami to defendant No. 3 (Kumar)."
FACTS,"Otherwise all the terms of the compromise Will stand cancelled and the plaintiffs shall not be competent to claim any right to or possession over the.land covered by the patta dated 11th March, 1921."
FACTS,"The patta which defend ant No. 3 executed in favour of the plaintiffs in respect of 5,800 bighas of coal land in village Rahraband shall remain in force, and the plaintiffs will get a decree of declara tion of their right and title to the 500 bighas of coal land in dispute but defendants 1 and 2 (the Deoshis) shall hold possession as tenants."
FACTS,"Besides the terms mentioned below, defendants 1 and 2 shall remain bound by all the remaining terms under which they took settlement of the 500 bighas of coal land from defendant No. 3 under 836 patta and Kabuliyat, and both the defendants 1 and 2 shall possess the same under the plaintiffs from generation to generation and all the terms of the said patta and Kabuliyat shall remain effective and in force between them."
FACTS,Both the defendants 1 and 2 shall remain bound to pay to the plain tiffs commission at the rate of 2a.
FACTS,per ton on all sorts of coal instead of 2a.
FACTS,"a ton as stated before in the patta of 5,800 bighas of land settled with the plaintiffs."
FACTS,"The plaintiffs shall pay to defendant No. 3 in future the mini mum royalty of Rs. 6,000 instead of Rs. 8,000 as stipulated in the original patta of 11 th March 1921 and commission at the rate of la."
FACTS,a ton in place of 2a.
FACTS,a ton as stipulat ed in the patta of March 21 .
FACTS,"Unless the plaintiffs pay to the defendant No. 3 Rs. 8,000 within 2 months from this day they shall not be competent to take out execution of this decree, nor shall they be competent to take posses sion of the land in dispute."
FACTS,"The defendants 1 and 2 within one month from the date of payment of Rs. 8,000 as aforesaid to defendant No. 3 shall execute a new Kabuliyat in favour of the plaintiff in respect of the modified terms stated above, i.e., on the condition to pay commission at the rate of 2a."
FACTS,per ton.
FACTS,"In the new patta which defendant No. 3 will execute in favour of the plaintiffs he shall embody the condition that the annual minimum royalty will be Rs. 6,000 instead of Rs. 8,000 and commission will be at the rate of la. 9p."
FACTS,per ton in place of 2a.
FACTS,per ton as mentioned in the aforesaid patta.
FACTS,"If the defendant No. 3 does not execute the parts on the aforesaid modified terms in favour 'of the plaintiffs within the time aforesaid and both the defendants 1 and 2 also do not execute a kabuliyat on the aforesaid modified terms, then this very rafanama shall be treated as the parts and kabuliyat, and the plaintiffs in accordance with the terms of the rafanama shall pay to defendant No. 3, Rs. 6,000 only as minimum royalty and commission at the rate of la."
FACTS,"per ton with respect to 5,800 bighas and shall continue to realise commission at the rate of 2a. 6p. per ton from defendants 1 and 2 who shall remain bound to pay the same."
FACTS,""" 837 The answer to the question whether this compromise decree requires registration depends on the legal effect of the changes in the status quo ante of the parties brought about by the document."
FACTS,"A careful analysis reveals the following alterations : (1) In the lease to the Singhs, the rate of royalty or commission was reduced from 2a."
FACTS,per ton of coal raised to la.
FACTS,"per ton and the minimum royalty was reduced from Rs. 8,000 to Rs. 6,000 while the area of coal land in their khas possession was reduced by 500 bighas. (2) In the lease to the Deoshis the rate of royalty or commission was enhanced from 2a."
FACTS,per ton to 2a.
FACTS,per ton and tiffs was made payable to the Singhs.
FACTS,"The Singhs and the Deoshis were brought into a new legal relationship, the former accepting the latter as tenants holding the disputed 500 bighas under them in consideration of the latter agreeing to pay the enhanced royalty to the former. (4) The whole arrangement was made conditional on the Singhs paying Rs. 8,000 to Kumar within 2 months from the date of the compromise, it being expressly provided that the Singhs were not to be entitled to execute the decree or to take possession of the disputed area of 503 bighas which evidently had not till then passed into their possession."
REASONING,"Now, sub section (1) of section 17 of the , enumerates five categories of documents of which regis tration is made compulsory which include"" (d) leases of immoveable property from year to year, or for any term exceeding one year, or reserving a yearly rent;""."
REASONING,"Sub sec tion (2) however provided that ""nothing in clauses (b) and (c) of sub section (1)applies to . (vi) any decree or order of court."
REASONING,""" It may be mentioned in passing that this clause was amended with affect from the 1st April, 1930, by the , so as to exclude from the scope of the exception compromise decrees comprising immovable property other than that which is the subject matter of the suit."
REASONING,But 838 the amendment cannot affect the document here in question which came into existence in 1923.
REASONING,"Before the amendment, the clause was held to cover even compromise decrees comprising immovable property which was not the subject matter of the suit: [Vide Hemanta Kumari Debi vs Midnapur Zamindari Co. ( ')]."
REASONING,"That decision applies to the present case and obviates the objection that because the compromise in question covered also the remaining 5,300 bighas which were not the subject matter of the title suit of 1921, it was outside the scope of the exception in sub section (2), clause (vi)."
REASONING,"The only question, therefore, is whether the compromise decree is a ""lease"" [which expression includes ""an agreement to lease"" by the definition in section 2 (7)] within the meaning of el."
REASONING,(d) of sub section (1).
REASONING,It is obvious that if the compromise decree fails within clause (d) of sub section (1) it would not be protected under clause (vi) of sub section (2) which excepts only documents falling under the categories (b) and (c) of sub section (1).
RLC,"The High Court was of opinion that, on a proper construction of the terms of the compromise, it did not fall under clause (d)."
RLC,"Mano har Lall J., who delivered the leading judgment, observed: ""It was a tripartite agreement embodied in the decree of the court and was, therefore, exempt from registration."
REASONING,"It will be oh.served also that so far as the defendants were con cerned, their possession of the 500 bighas was not inter fered with and they still remained in possession as the lessees, but instead of paying the royalty to the plaintiffs it was agreed between all the parties that the defendants would pay the royalty in future to Shibsaran and Sitcram."
ARG,"If the matter had stood there, the learned Advocate for the appellant could not have seriously contested the position, but he vehemently argued that when the agreement was not to pay the same amount of royalty or commission as previously agreed to but an altered amount of royalty and commission, the document should be held to fall within the mischief of section 17 (1)(d)of the (1) P.C. 839 ."
RPC,"The answer to this contention is, as I have stated just now, to be found in the Full Bench decision of this court :"" [see Charu Chandra Mitra 's case ()]."
RPC,It was there held that a mere alteration of the rent reserved does not make the transaction a new lease so as to bring it within clause (d)of subsection (1).
RPC,We are unable to share this view.
REASONING,"It oversimplifies the compromise transaction which, in our opinion, involves much more than a mere alteration of the royalties stipulated for in the previous pattas executed by Kumar."
REASONING,"Nor can we accept the suggestion of Mr. Chatterjee for the respondents theft the compromise operated as an assignment to the Singhs by Kumar of the latter 's reversion under the ""lease granted to the Deoshis and all that the latter did was to acknowledge the Singhs as their landlords and attern to them."
REASONING,"On tiffs view it was said that the transaction would not fall under clause (d), although it would fall under clause (b) but then would be saved by the exception in clause (vi) of sub section (2)."
REASONING,"The argument, however, overlooks that Kumar had leased the area of 5,800 bighas to the Singhs by his patta dated 11th March, 1921, and the compromise by providing that the Singhs should pay the reduced royalty of 1a."
REASONING,per ton in respect of the whole area preserved Kumar 's reversion intact.
REASONING,"He could not therefore be deemed to have assigned any part of his inter est in 5,800 bighas as landlord to the Singhs who continue to hold the entire extent as tenants under him."
REASONING,What the compromise really did was.
REASONING,"as stated already, to bring the Singhs and the Deoshis into a new legal relationship as underlessor and under lessee in respect of 500 bighas which were the subject matter of the title suit; in other words, its legal effect was to create a perpetual underlease be tween the Singhs and the Deoshis which would clearly fall under clause (d) but for the circumstance that it was to take effect only on condition float the Singhs paid Rs. 8,000 to Kumar within 2 months (1) 840 thereafter."
PRECEDENT,"As pointed out by the Judicial Committee in Hemanta Kumar 's case (1) ""An agreement for a lease, which a lease is by the statute declared to include, must, in their Lordships ' opinion, be a document which effects an actual demise and operates as a lease ."
PRECEDENT,"The phrase which in the context where it occurs and in the statute in which it is found, must in their opinion relate to some document which creates a present and immediate interest in the land."
REASONING,""" The compromise decree expressly provides that unless the sum of Rs. 8,000 was paid within the stipulated time the Singhs were not to execute the decree or to take possession of the disputed property."
RPC,Until the payment was made it was impossible to determine whether there would be any under lease or not.
RPC,Such a contingent agreement is not within clause (d) and although it is covered by clause (b). is excepted by clause (vi) of sub section ( '2).
RPC,We therefore agree with the conclusion of the High Court though on dif ferent grounds and dismiss the appeal with costs.
RPC,Appeal dismisseel.

COUNSEL,"P.L. Banerjee (H. J. Urnrigal, with him), for the respondents."
FACTS,"MLKHERJEA J. This is an appeal against a judjment and decree of a Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court dated April 22, 1943, which reversed on appeal those of the Civil Judge of Basti dated 6th of November 1939."
FACTS,"The suit, out of which the appeal arises, was commenced by the plaintiff, whose successor the present appellant is, to recover a sum of Rs. 11,935 by enforcement of a simple mortgage bond."
FACTS,"The mortgage deed is dated the 8th of March 1926 and was executed by Raja Pateshwari Partap Narain Singh, the then holder of Basti Raj which is an impartible estate governed by the rule of primogeniture, in favour of Bhikhiram Sahu, the father of the original plaintiff Ramdeo, to secure a loan of Rs. 5,500 advanced by the mortgagee on hypothecation of certain immovable properties appertaining to the estate of the mortgagor."
FACTS,The loan carried interest at the rate of 9 per cent per annum and there was a stipula tion to pay the mortgage money within one year from the date of the bond.
FACTS,"The mortgagor and the mortgagee were both dead at the time when the suit was instituted, and the plaintiff in the action was Ramdeo Sahu, the son and heir of the mortgagee, while the principal defendant was the eldest son of the mortgagor who succeeded to the Basti estate under the rule of primogeniture."
FACTS,"It was stated in the plaint that absolutely nothing was paid by the mortgagor or his succes sor towards the mortgage dues and the plaintiff claimed the principal amount of Rs. 5,500 together with interest at the rate of 9 per cent."
FACTS,per annum up to the date of the suit.
FACTS,"A number of pleas were taken by the contesting defend ant in answer to the plaintiff 's claim, most of which are not relevant for our present purpose."
FACTS,The 783 substantial contentions raised by the defendant were of a three fold character.
FACTS,"In the first place, it was urged that the document sued upon was not a properly attested or valid ly registered document and could not operate as a mortgage instrument in law."
FACTS,"The second contention raised was that there was no consideration in support of the transaction, at least to the extent of Rs. 2,000, which was represented by items 3 and 4 of the consideration clause in the document."
FACTS,The third and the last material defence related to a claim for relief under the United Provinces Agriculturists ' Relief Act.
RLC,The trial Judge held in favour of the defendant on the last point mentioned above and negatived his other pleas.
FACTS,"The result was that he made a preliminary decree for sale in favour of the plaintiff for recovery of the principal sum of Rs. 5,500 with interest at certain rates as are sanctioned by the U.P. Agriculturists ' Relief Act; and agreeably to the provisions of that Act the decretal dues were directed to be paid in a number of instalments."
RLC,"Against this decision, the defendant took an appeal to the High Court of Allahabad which was heard by a Division Bench consisting of Verma and York JJ."
RLC,"The learned Judges reversed the judgment of the trial Judge and dismissed the plaintiff 's suit on one ground only, viz., that the bond was not attested in the manner required by law and consequently could not rank as a mortgage bond; and as the suit was instituted beyond 6 years from the date of the bond, no money decree could be claimed by the plaintiff."
FACTS,"It is against this judgment that the plaintiff has come up on appeal to this court, and the main contention raised by the learned Attorney General, who appeared in support of the appeal, is that in arriving at its decision on the question of attestation, the High Court approached the matter from a wrong standpoint altogether and on the materi als in the record it had no justification for reversing the findings of the trial court on that point."
REASONING,"In such cases, the appellate court has got to bear in mind that it has not the advantage which the trial Judge had in having the witnesses before him and of observing the manner in which they deposed in court."
REASONING,"This certainly does not mean that when an appeal lies on facts, the appellate court is not competent to reverse a finding of fact arrived at by the trial Judge."
REASONING,"The rule is and it is nothing more than a rule of practice that when there is conflict of oral evidence of the parties on any matter in issue and the decision hinges upon the credibility of the witnesses, then unless there is some special feature about the evidence of a par ticular witness which has escaped the trial Judge 's notice or there is a sufficient balance of improbability to dis place his opinion as to where the credibility lies, the appellate court should not interfere with the finding of the trial Judge on a question of fact(1)."
PRECEDENT,"The gist of the numer ous decisions on this subject was clearly summed up by Viscount Simon in Watt vs Thomas(2), and his observations were adopted and reproduced in extenso by the Judicial Committee in a very recent appeal from the Madras High Court(3)."
PRECEDENT,"The observations are as follows: ""But if the evidence as a whole can reasonably be re garded as justifying the conclusion arrived at at the trial, and especially if that conclusion has been arrived at on confliciting testimony by a tribunal which saw and heard the witnesses, the appellate court will bear in mind that it has not enjoyed this opportunity and that the view of the trial Judge as to where credibility lies is entitled to great weight."
PRECEDENT,"Like other tribunals, he may go wrong on a question of fact, but it is a cogent circumstance that a Judge of first instance, when (1) Vide Lord Atkin 's observations in W.C. Macdonald vs Fred Latinmer, AI.R. 1929 P.C. 15, 18."
PRECEDENT,"(3) Vide Saraveeraswami vs Talluri, A.I.R. 785 estimating the value of verbal testimony, has the advantage (which is denied to Courts of appeal)of having the witnesses before him and observing the manner in which their evidence is given."
PRECEDENT,""" It is in the light of these observations that we propose to examine the propriety of the decision of the s learned Judges of the High Court in the present case."
REASONING,"It will appear that the mortgage deed besides containing the signature of the executant, purports to bear the signatures of three other persons, two of whom are described as attesting wit nesses and the third one as the scribe."
REASONING,Harbhajan Lal and Jawala Prasad Tewari purport to have signed the document as attesting witnesses and Jawala Prasad Patwari is the person who has signed it as the scribe.
REASONING,"Jawala Prasad Tewari was admittedly dead when the suit was brought and Harbhajan Lal, the only surviving attesting witness was called on behalf of the plaintiff to prove the execution of the deed as is required under section 68 of the Indian Evidence Act."
REASONING,"Harbhajan Lal stated in the witness box that he did sign the document as a witness and so did Jawala Prasad Tewari, but neither of them signed it in the presence of the mortgagor; nor did the mortgagor sign in their presence."
FACTS,"He was cross examined by the defendant also and in answer to the questions put to him by the defendant 's lawyer, he stated that he signed the deed at the Collector ate Kutchery, meaning thereby the Bar Library, where he used to sit as a petition writer and the document was taken to him at that place by Bhikhi Ram Sahu, the mortgagee, Ghur Lal, a Karinda of the mortgagor, and Jawala Prasad Patwari, the scribe."
FACTS,Jawala Prasad Tewari signed the deed after him.
FACTS,The mortgagor certainly did not come to that place and his signature was already on the deed when the witness signed it.
FACTS,"The details of the defendant 's version relating to execution of this document were given by Jawala Prasad Patwari, who was the principal witness on the 786 side of the defendatnt."
FACTS,He says that he prepared the draft at the sherista or the office of the Raja Sahib which is outside his Kot or palace.
FACTS,"The draft was prepared under instructions from Bhikhi Ram, the mortgagee."
FACTS,"and Ghur Lal, the Karinda of the mortgagor, both of whom were present when the draft was prepared."
FACTS,"After the draft was fair copied and stamped, the witness signed it as the scribe and then it was taken by Bhikhi Ram and Ghur Lal to the Kot or palace of the Raja for his signature."
FACTS,"After obtaining the Raja 's signa ture, Bhikhi Ram went away to his house and some time later he as well as Bhikhi Ram and Ghur Lal went to the Collector ate Kutchery, where they took the signatures of Harbhajan Lal and Jawala Prasad Tewari."
FACTS,"They then went to the registration office, where the document was presented for registration by Jainarayan Sukul who held a general power of attorney for the Raja."
FACTS,"As against this, there is a completely different version given by the plaintiff himself and his witness Buddhu Lal."
FACTS,"According to the plaintiff, the document was executed and attested at one and the same sitting in the Kot or palace of the Raja; the terms had been settled beforehand between Bhikhi Ram and the mortgagor and on the 8th of November 1926 the plaintiff himself, and not his father, went to the Raja 's palace at about 10 or 11 A.M. in the morning to get the document executed."
FACTS,"He was accompanied by three persons to wit Harbhajan Lal, the deed writer of his father, Buddhu Lal, an old servant of the family, and Jawala Prasad Tewari who was also well known to the plaintiff and was taken to bear witness to the deed."
FACTS,They found Jawala Prasad Patwari already with the Raja when they reached the Kot.
FACTS,The draft was prepared by Buddhu Lal at the suggestion of the Raja.
FACTS,"It was the plaintiff 's desire that the final document should be scribed by Harbhajan Lal but as the Raja wanted to oblige Jawala Prasad Patwari, who was the Patwari of Basti proper, the deed was faired out and scribed by Jawala Prasad patwari."
FACTS,"After the Raja had put his signature on the 787 document in the presence of Harbhajan Lal and Tewari, both the latter signed the document in the presence of the Raja."
FACTS,The subsequent events narrated by the plaintiff relate to the registration of the document and we do not consider them to be material for our present purpose.
FACTS,"This story of the plaintiff is supported materially and on all points by Buddhu Lal, who was an old servant of the family, though he was no longer in service when he deposed in court."
FACTS,There were thus two conflicting versions placed before the court and each side attempted to substantiate its case by verbal testimony of witnesses.
RLC,The trial Judge was to decide which of the two versions was correct and he ac cepted the story of the plaintiff and rejected that of the defendant.
RLC,"The learned Judges of the High Court in dealing with the appeal do observe, at the beginning of their discussions, that on a question of fact the appellate court should be slow to differ from the conclusions arrived at by the trial Judge who had seen and heard the witnesses; but in their opinion, this rule did not apply to the present case as the trial Judge here did not base his conclusions on the impres sions created in his mind by the witnesses who deposed before him."
RLC,"What the trial Judge relied upon, it is said, was not the demeanour of the witnesses as index of their credibility but upon the inherent improbability of the circumstances deposed to by the defendant 's witnesses."
RLC,"It is observed by the High Court that the trial Judge, when he found the defendant 's story to be improbable, should have considered whether or not there were improbable features in the plaintiff 's case also, and whether the evidence of the plaintiff and his servant Buddhu Lal merited credence at all."
RLC,The learned Judges of the High Court then proceed to examine and discuss at great length the different reasons put forward by the trial Judge in support of his finding that the defendant 's case was unreliable.
RLC,These reasons are held to be inconclusive and unsound and the High Court further found that the plaintiff 's story 788 as narrated by him and his servant is improbable and not worthy of belief.
RLC,"In our opinion, the High Court 's approach to the case has not been proper and its findings are unsupportable on the materials in the record."
RLC,Here was a case where the controversy related to a 'pure question of fact which had to be determined by weighing and appraising of conflicting oral testimony adduced by the parties.
RLC,"It cannot be denied that in estimating the value of oral testimony, the trial Judge, who sees and hears the witnesses, has an advantage which the appellate court does not possess."
RLC,The High Court was wrong in thinking that it would detract from the value to be attached to a trial Judge 's finding of fact if the Judge does not expressly base his conclusion upon the impressions he gathers from the demeanour of witnesses (1).
REASONING,"Applying this principle to the present case, we do not think that the High Court was justified in reversing the finding of the trial Judge on the question of attestiation of the document."
REASONING,"In the opinion of the High Court the story narrated by the plaintiff and his servant is untrue, and the main reason given is that it is not at all probable that the plaintiff and not his father Bhikhi Ram was present at the palace of the Raja when the document was executed."
REASONING,"The mortgagor, it is said, was an influential person in the locality occupying a very high social position and it would be indecorous and against Indian customs for a man like Bhikhi Ram not to be personally present when the Raja was going 'to execute a document in his favour."
PRECEDENT,"The learned Judges seem to think that the plaintiff was not really at the spot when the mortgage deed was executed and as Bhikhi Ram was dead, this story was manufactured by the plaintiff in order to Vide the observations of Lord Carson in Nether landsche Handel Maatschappij v, R.M.P. Chettiar Firm and Others, A.I.R 1929 P.O. 202, 205."
REASONING,Mr. Banerjee appearing for the defendant respondent went to the length of suggesting that it was only after Harbhajan Lal turned hostile in the witness box and denied that he attested the document that the new story was invented by the plaintiff.
REASONING,We think that this argument rests on an extremely flimsy basis which does not bear examination.
REASONING,"It may be that the Raja was a man of high social position, but it should be remembered that he was in the position of a borrower and moreover it was not the first time that he was borrowing money from Bhikhi Ram."
REASONING,"As, however, he was the Raja of Basti, the document was executed at his palace and not in the house of the mortgagee and if as the plaintiff says, the terms were already settled between Bhikhi Ram and the Raja and the only thing left was to embody the agreed terms in writing, we fail to see why it was absolutely necessary for Bhikhi Ram to wait upon the mortgagor personally; and why his adult son, who was sufficiently old and experienced in business affairs, could not represent him in the transac tion."
REASONING,The suggestion of Mr. Banerjee that the new story was invented after the plaintiff had seen Harbhajan Lal giving evidence against him in the witness box is not worthy of serious consideration having regard to the fact that the plaintiff himself stepped into the witness box immediately after Harbhajan Lal had finished his deposition.
REASONING,It seems to us also that the presence of Harbhajan Lal and Buddbu Lal at the sitting when the mortgage transaction took place was quite a probable and natural thing which cannot give rise to any suspicion.
REASONING,"It appears from the evidence on the record that Harbhajan Lal, who was a pro fessional deed writer, was usually employed for writing deeds of the plaintiff 's father and he figured either as a scribe or as an attesting witness in various documents to which the plaintiff 's father was a party."
REASONING,It was quite natural for the plaintiff in such circumstances to take Harbhajan Lal alongwith him to the Raja 's palace on the day that the 790 mortgage bond was executed and we see no reason to disbe lieve the plaintiff 's statement that his original intention was to have the deed scribed by Harbhajan Lal.
RLC,It is said by the High Court that in the mofussil districts in the United Provinces the Patwari is the person generally em ployed for drafting and scribing deeds.
REASONING,This cannot mean that all the people in the district of Basti used to have their deeds drafted and scribed by the Patwari.
REASONING,"We have exhibited documents in the records of this case where the name of Harbhajan Lal appears as the scribe; and so far as the plaintiff 's father was concerned, there is no doubt whatsoever that Harbhajan Lal was the scribe ordinarily employed to do his work."
REASONING,"In this case also if Jawala Prasad Patwari had not been present on the spot, the plaintiff would certainly have the document scribed by Harbhajan Lal, as so many documents in favour of the plaintiff 's father had been scribed by this man on previous occasions."
REASONING,We see nothing improbable in the story that it was out of deference to the wishes of the Raja that the plaintiff consented to the document being scribed by Jawala Prasad Patwari.
REASONING,"As regards Buddhu Lal, it is not disputed that he was an old and a trusted servant of the plaintiff 's family."
REASONING,"That he was trusted in business matters is clear from the fact that his name appears as a witness in the registered receipt (exhibit 10) given by Sheo Balak Ram, to whom a sum of Rs. 500 was paid by Bhikhi Ram under the terms of the dis puted mortgage deed."
REASONING,We fail to see why it was improbable that Buddhu Lal would accompany the plaintiff to the Raja 's palace on the day of the execution of the document.
REASONING,The trial Judge relied to some extent upon the fact that the signatures of the executant and Harbhajan Lal were in the same ink in support of his conclusion that Harbhajan Lal signed the document at the place of its execution and not at the Collectorate Kutchery as alleged by him.
REASONING,"Speak ing for ourselves, we do not attach much importance to the similarity in the ink which is after all not a very reliable test; but we do agree wit.h the trial Judge in holding that Harbhajan 791 Lal must have signed the document at the time when it was executed and not afterwards; and it is really inconceivable that an old and experienced deed writer like him did not know the requirements of proper attestation."
REASONING,On his own evidence he had attested numerous documents and he could not recall.
REASONING,a single instance where he signed the document in such manner as he did in the present case.
REASONING,The ' way in which the learned Judges of the High Court have attempted to explain away this part of Harbhajan Lal 's evidence does not appear to be satisfactory.
REASONING,"The other observation made by the High Court in this connection that in this particular province there are many persons who are acquainted with law but do not care to comply with its requirements on account of carelessness, indifference, sloth or over confidence is not relevant and need not be taken seriously."
REASONING,"Whatever that may be, we have no hesitation in holding that Harbhajan Lal knew perfectly well what attestation means in law and he did sign the document as an attesting witness at the Raja 's Kot after the document was executed."
REASONING,Jawala Prasad Patwari is apparently a man under the control of the defendant and cannot be trusted.
REASONING,Why Harbha jan Lal did go over to the defendant 's side is a question which may not admit of an easy answer.
REASONING,"The trial Judge seems to be of opinion that it was probably due to the influence exercised by Jawala Prasad Patwari, who is a co villager of Harbhajan."
REASONING,"We think it unnecessary to specu late upon these matters, for in our opinion Harbhajan Lal stands condemned by his own statement in court."
REASONING,Our conclusion is that the finding of the trial Judge on the question of attestation is perfectly consistent with the circumstances and probabilities of the case and the learned Judge did not omit anything which ought to have been present to his mind in coming to a conclusion.
REASONING,"The evidence on the record taken as a whole fully supports the finding, and in our opinion the High Court has reversed it on totally inade quate grounds."
RPC,The result is that the appeal must be allowed and the judgment of the High Court should be 792 set aside.
RPC,"As the High Court, however, has dismissed the suit only on the ground of non attestation of the mortgage bond and did not consider the other points which were raised before it, the case must go back to that court in order that the other matters, which have been left undecided, may be heard and decided by the learned Judges and the case dis posed of in accordance with law."
RPC,The plaintiff appellant is entitled to costs of this hearing as well as the costs of the High Court against defendant No. 1.
RPC,Appeal allowed.

CITATION,"Equivalent citations: 1953 AIR 425, 1950 SCR 806"
COUNSEL,"P. Somasundaram (V. V. Choudhry, with him) for the appellant."
COUNSEL,"V. Rangachari (K. Mangachari, with him) for the respond ents. 1950."
JUDGE,The Court delivered judgment as follows.
FACTS,How this point arises will be clear from a brief statement of the facts of the case.
FACTS,"It appears that in 1908, one Veeresalingam, the husband of the first respondent, borrowed a sum of Rs. 9,000 from one Sitharamayya, and executed a mortgage bond in his fa vour."
FACTS,"Subsequently a suit was 808 instituted by the mortgagee to enforce the mortgage and a final decree in that suit was passed on the 19th August, 1926."
FACTS,"Thereafter, on the 28th October, 1931,the decree holder applied for the execution of the decree by the sale of the mortgaged property."
FACTS,"In 193a, the decree holder transferred the decree to one Sobhanadri, after whose death his son, the appellant before us, was brought on the record as his legal representative in the execution proceedings."
FACTS,"Several years before the assignment of the decree, Veeresa lingam, the defendant, had died and his widow, the first respondent."
FACTS,was therefore brought on the record as his legal representative.
FACTS,"On the 6th July, 1935, two items of proper ty were sold in execution of the decree and purchased by the decree holder, these being : (1) a village called Tedlam in in West Godavari District; and (2) 4 acres and 64 cents of land in Madepalli village."
FACTS,"The first property was sold for Rs. 21,000 and the second for ' Rs. 1,025."
FACTS,"As, however, the amount due under the decree was only about Rs. 17,860 and odd, the sale of the second property was subsequently set aside and the decree holder deposited into Court the excess amount of about Rs. 3,000 and odd after setting off the decretal amount against the price of the first item of property."
FACTS,"On the 5th August, 1935, the first respondent filed an application under Order XXI, rule 90, and section 47 of the Code of Civil Procedure, to set aside the sale held in July, 1935, alleging certain irregularities in the conduct of the sale."
FACTS,"That application was after several years heard by the Subordinate Judge of Ellore, who by his order dated the 6th March, 1943, dismissed it and directed the sale of the first property to be confirmed and full satisfaction of the decree to be entered."
FACTS,"After about 12 days, i.e., on the 18th March, 1943, the first respondent and the second respondent, who had been adopted by the former on the 12th March, 1936, under the will of her hus band and was subsequently brought on record, filed an appli cation under section 19 of the Madras Act praying for cer tain reliefs under that Act."
FACTS,"This application ' was dismissed on the 22nd March, 1943."
FACTS,"Subsequently, two appeals were filed on behalf 809 of the respondents (who will hereinafter be sometimes re ferred to as judgment debtors), one against the order refus ing to set aside the sale under Order XXI, rule 90 of the Civil Procedure Code, and the other against the order dis missing the application under the Madras Act."
RLC,"These appeals were heard together by two learned Judges of the Madras High Court and they took the view that the judgment debtors ' application under the Madras Act was maintainable notwith standing the fact that the sale had been confirmed and full satisfaction of the decree recorded, and remitted the case to the trial Court for a finding on the following questions, namely (1) whether the applicants were agriculturists; and (2) if so, what would be the result of applying the provisions of Madras Act IV of 1938 to the decretal debt against them ? So far as regards the judgment debtors ' appeal against the order dismissing their application under Order XXI, rule 90, the Learned Judges were inclined to agree with the trial Court that the sale should stand but declined to pass final orders in the appeal on the ground that ""it would seriously prejudice the judgment debtors in the connected application for relief under section 19 of the Madras Act IV of 1938."
RLC,""" The Subordinate Judge answered the questions referred to him by the High Court on remand as follows : (1) The judgment debtors were not agriculturists and were not therefore entitled to the benefits of the Madras Act;and (2) If they were agriculturists, they were not liable to pay anything under the decree, as, in view of the provisions of the Act, the debt stood discharged on the date of sale."
RLC,"When however the matter came up before the learned Judges of the High Court, they reversed the first finding of the trial Court and held that the judgmentdebtors were agriculturists within the meaning of the 810 Act, and that the debt stood discharged in view of section 8 (2) of the Act."
RLC,"At the same time, they held that the sale was not liable to be set aside, and in this view dismissed one of the appeals and allowed the other."
FACTS,"Then followed certain proceedings to which it would have been unnecessary to refer but for the fact that the judgment debtors have attempted to rely on ""them in support of one of their preliminary objections to the maintainability of these appeals."
FACTS,"It appears that on the next day after the judgment of the High Court was delivered in the two appeals, counsel for the respondents wrote a letter to the Registrar of the High Court to direct the posting of the two cases 'for being mentioned ' before the Court in order to obtain necessary directions consequent on the orders passed by it in the appeals."
FACTS,"This letter was not placed before the learned Judges until the judgment had been signed by them and ac cordingly the judgment debtors filed two petitions, one being a review petition to the High Court and the other being a petition to the trial Court praying ""that the de creeholder may be ordered to pay to the petitioners the purchase money of Rs. 21,000 with interest thereon at 6 per cent."
FACTS,per annum from the date of sale till the date of payment.
RLC,""" The trial Court dismissed the latter petition on the ground that it was not maintainable, and the judgment debtors filed an appeal against the order."
RLC,The appeal as well as the review petition of the judgment debtors were heard together by the learned Judges who directed the decree holder 's counsel to elect whether his client would deposit the purchase money into Court or have the sale set aside.
RLC,"The decree holder applied for a short adjournment and ultimately on the 15th November, 1946, his counsel stated that his client wished to retain the property which he had purchased and to pay the purchase money into Court."
RLC,"Thereupon, he was directed to pay the sum of Rs. 21,000 together with interest within a months from that date."
RLC,"Subsequently, the appellant (decree holder) having obtained leave to appeal from the High Court preferred 811 these appeals before us."
RLC,"It may be stated here that along with the application for leave to appeal, the appellant had filed an application for excusing the delay in filing the former application which he accounted for mainly by refer ring to the proceedings for the review of the judgments in the previous appeals to the High Court."
RLC,This application was granted and the delay was condoned.
RLC,"As has been already stated, the main point arising in these appeals relates to the effect of the Madras Act upon this litigation."
RLC,"That Act was passed and came into effect in 1938, while the execution proceedings were still continu ing."
FACTS,"It will be recalled that the sale took place on the 6th July, 1935; and the application for setting it aside was not disposed of until the 6th March, 1943."
FACTS,"But, strangely enough, the judgmentdebtors did not apply for any relief under the Madras Act during this period, and they made their application only after the sale had been confirmed and satisfaction of the decree had been entered."
FACTS,"How far this belated application affects the right claimed by the judg ment debtors under the Act is one of the questions raised in these appeals, and I shall deal with it after referring to the material provisions of the Act and the findings of the High Court which have given rise to several debatable points."
STATUTE,"The sections of the Act which are material for the purpose of these appeals are sections 3, 8 and 19."
STATUTE,Section 3 defines an agriculturist and has a proviso stating that in certain cases a person shall not be deemed to be an agricul turist.
STATUTE,"The other material sections 8 and 19 run as follows : ""8."
STATUTE,"Debts incurred before the 1st October, 1932, shall be scaled down in the manner mentioned hereunder, namely: (1) All interest outstanding on the 1st October, 1937, in favour of any creditor of an agriculturist whether the same be payable under law, custom or contract or under a decree of Court and whether the debt or other obligation has ripened into a decree or not, shall be deemed to be dis charged, and only the principal or such portion thereof as may be outstanding shall be deemed to be the amount repay able by the agriculturist on that date."
STATUTE,"(2) Where an agriculturist has paid to any creditor twice the amount of the principal whether by way of princi pal or interest or both, such debt including the principal, shall be deemed to be wholly discharged."
STATUTE,"(3) Where the sums repaid by way of principal or inter est or both fall short of twice the amount of the principal, such amount only as would make up this shortage, or the principal amount or such portion of the principal amount as is outstanding, whichever is smaller, shall be repayable."
STATUTE,"(4) Subject to the provisions of sections 22 to 25, nothing contained in sub sections (1), (2) and (8) shall be deemed to require the creditor to refund any sum which has been paid to him, or to increase the liability of a debtor to pay any sum in excess of the amount which would have been payable by him if this Act had not been passed."
REASONING,"Where a debt has been renewed or included in a fresh document in favour of the same creditor, the principal originally advanced by the creditor together with such sums, if any, as have been subsequently advanced as principal shall alone be treated as the principal sum repay able by the agriculturist under this section."
REASONING,"Where ' before the commencement of this Act, a Court has passed a decree for the repayment of a debt, it shall, on the application of any judgmentdebtor who is an agricul turist or in respect of a Hindu joint family debt, on the application of any member of the family whether or not he is the judgment debtor or on the application of the decree holder, apply the provisions of this Act to such decree and shall, notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, amend the decree accordingly or enter satisfaction, as the case may be: Provided that all payments made or amounts recovered, whether before or after the commencement of this Act, in respect of any such decree shall first be applied in payment of all costs as originally decreed to the creditor."
REASONING,""" These sections are material, because in the present case the judgment debtors asked the decree to be amended under section 19 of the Act and they were held to be entitled to relief under section 8."
REASONING,"Having referred to the relevant provisions of the Act, it becomes necessary now to state the main findings of the High Court upon which the decision of this appeal will turn."
REASONING,"These findings are (1) that the sale of Tedlam village, which was held on the 6th July, 1935, and confirmed on the 6th March, 19 13, was a good sale; (2) that by this sale."
REASONING,the title to the Tedlain village passed to the decree hoMer.
REASONING,"and in hearing the appeal the High Court was justified in proceeding on the footing that the judgment debtors having ceased to be the owners of Tedlam village after its sale, were not 104 814 hit by clause (D) of the proviso to section a of the Act; and (3) that the decree had been satisfied at the date of the sale and the decree holder was liable to repay to the judg ment debtors the full price of the property which was sold."
REASONING,"The main contentions directed against the conclusions arrived at by the High Court are :firstly, that they are self contradictory, because if the sale was an effective sale on the date it was held or confirmed, the decree was also satisfied on that date and the judgmentdebtors were no longer entitled to invoke the provisions of the Madras Act; and secondly, that the view taken by the learned Judges of the High Court that notwithstanding the appeal against the order refusing to set aside the sale they could proceed on the footing that the judgment debtors had ceased to be the owners of Tedlarn village on the date of the sale was un sound in law."
REASONING,It will first deal with the second point which appears to me to require serious consideration.
REASONING,"The High Court has in my opinion rightly proceeded on the footing that the ownership of Tedlam village would bring the judgment debtors within the mischief of clause (D) of the proviso to section 3 of the Act, and would disentitle them to any relief thereunder."
REASONING,"This view was contested before us on behalf of the judgment debtors on two grounds : (1) that the grant in favour of the ancestor of the judgment debtors did not comprise a whole inam village and what they owned was therefore not an estate under the Madras Estates Land Act (Madras Act I of 1908); (2) that on the date of the application, the judg ment debtxrs were not landholders of village Tedlam because the village was in the possession of a receiver since 1st February, 1937, and the latter was in law the landholder on the crucial date."
REASONING,None of these contentions however appears to me to have any force.
REASONING,The first contention was sought to be supported by Exhibit P 1 which is a register of inams and which shows that poramboke or waste lands to the extent of 596 acres had to be deducted from the area 815 of the inam.
REASONING,"The point however has been dealt with very fully and clearly by the learned Subordinate Judge, who has rightly pointed out that it has no force in view of the Madras Estates Land (Amendment) Act, 1945 [Madras Act No. II of 1945]."
REASONING,"The second point is equally unsubstantial, be cause it is well settled that the owner of a property does not cease to be its owner merely because it is placed in the hands of a receiver."
REASONING,"The true position is that the receiver represents the real owner whoever he may be, and the true owner does not by the mere appointment of a receiver cease to be a landholder under the Madras Estates Land Act."
REASONING,"I will now revert to the crucial question in the case, viz., whether the learned Judges of the High Court were justified in law in deciding the appeal on the footing that the judgment debtors had ceased to be the owners of Tedlain village and on that account they were not hit by clause (D)."
STATUTE,of the proviso to section 3 of the Madras Act.
REASONING,"At this stage, it will be useful to refer to certain provisions of the Civil Procedure Code which directly bear on the question as to when title to immovable property which is sold in execution of a decree is deemed to pass to the purchaser."
REASONING,"One of the provisions is Order XXI, rule 92, which provides that ""where no application is made under rule 89, rule 90 or rule 91, or where such application is made and disallowed, the Court shall make an order confirming the sale, and thereupon the sale shall become absolute."
REASONING,""" The second rele vant provision is section 65 which runs thus : ""Where immovable property is sold in execution of a decree and such sale has become absolute, the property shall be deemed to have vested in the purchaser from the time when the property is sold and not from the time when the sale becomes absolute."
PRECEDENT,""" In Bhawani Kunwar vs Mathurn Prasad Singh(1) the ques tion as to when a mortgagee who has purchased certain vil lages in execution of the decree acquired title to the properties purchased by him directly arose for considera tion, and the Privy Council rightly pointed (1) T.L.R. 816 out that ""the sale in execution of the mortgage decree took effect from the actual date of the sale and not from its confirmation."" In a simple case, the provisions cited above should settle the controversy, but, in the present case, the matter has been complicated on account of the appeal against the order refusing to set aside the sale under Order XXI, rule 90."
PRECEDENT,"In such a case, generally speaking, the true position seems to be that there is no finality until the litigation is finally determined by the appellate Court."
PRECEDENT,"This principle has been recognized in a number of cases, but it will be enough to cite Chandramani Shaha vs Anarjan Bibi(1)."
PRECEDENT,"The headnote of that case runs as follows : ""Where a Subordinate Judge has disallowed an applica tion under Order XXI, rule 90, to set aside a sale in execu tion, and has made an order under rule (1) confirming the sale, and an appeal from disallowance has been dismissed by the High Court, the three years ' period provided by the Indian Limitation Act, 1908, Schedule I, article 180, for an application under Order XXI, rule 95."
PRECEDENT,"by the purchaser for delivery of possession runs from the date of the order on appeal; the High Court having under the Code of Civil Proce dure, 1908, the same powers as the Subordinate Judge, the 'time when the sale becomes absolute ', for the purpose of article 180 is when the High Court disposes of the appeal."" Under article 180 of the Indian Limitation Act, the period of limitation runs ""from the date when the sale becomes absolute."
PRECEDENT,""" If we give a narrow and literal meaning to these words, the period of limitation should be held to run from the date when the original Court of execution confirms the sale."
PRECEDENT,"But, as was pointed out by the Privy Council, the High Court as an appellate Court had the same powers as the trial Court and it is only when the appeal was dismissed by the High Court that the order of the trial Court confirming the sale became absolute."
PRECEDENT,"Till the deci sion of the appellate Court, no finality was attached to the order confirming the sale."
REASONING,"If the order recording satisfac tion of the decree was not final and remained an inchoate order until the appeal was decided, the order confirming the sale would have the same inchoate character."
REASONING,This position seems to have been fully conceded in the statement of their case filed on behalf of the respondents in this Court.
REASONING,It is quite clear that in this case the learned Judges of the High Court have taken up an inconsistent position.
REASONING,"As I have already stated, they have held, for the purpose of allowing one of the appeals, that the judgment debtors were not hit by clause (D)of the proviso to section 3 of the Act because they ceased to be the owners of Tedlain village at the date of the sale in 1935."
REASONING,"If this conclusion is cor rect, it must follow as a matter of logic that the decree was completely satisfied on the date of the sale, because the sale fetched a larger amount than what was payable under the decree and the excess amount was deposited by the de cree holder in Court."
REASONING,The sale and satisfaction must go together and if finality is to be attached to the sale it should have been held to attach also to the order recording satisfaction of the decree.
REASONING,"It seems clear to me that if the decree had ceased to exist, no relief could be claimed by the judgment debtors under the Madras Act."
REASONING,"On the other hand, if the appeal had to be decided on the footing that the order recording satisfaction of the decree was not final, the same approach should have been made in regard to the effect of the sale."
REASONING,"It is also clear that if the decree was satisfied on the date of sale by the application of the provisions of the Act, the sale could not stand, because how could the property be sold in execution of a decree which had been already satisfied."
REASONING,"Yet, notwithstanding the fact that nothing was due under the decree, the High Court has held that the sale was a good sale and was to stand."
REASONING,The correct approach to the case would have been to assume for the purpose of the appeals that neither of the orders passed by the 818 Subordinate Judge was final.
REASONING,"On that view, the appeals to the High Court could not have been decided on the footing that the judgment debtors had ceased to be the owners of Tedlain property and were therefore not hit by clause (D) of the proviso to section 3 of the Madras Act."
REASONING,"In my opinion, the judgment of the High Court cannot be sustained, and the appeal s will have to be allowed."
REASONING,I will now deal very briefly with two preliminary objec tions raised on behalf of the respondents.
REASONING,"The first objec tion is that the application for leave to appeal to his Majesty in Council against the order of the High Court was barred by limitation, inasmuch as the reasons stated in the affidavit filed by the appellant in the High Court in sup port of his application for excusing delay do not consti tute sufficient reason within the meaning of section 5 of the Limitation Act."
REASONING,The answer to this objection will be found in the facts which have been already narrated.
REASONING,The delay was caused mainly by reason of the review of the order of the High Court and the High Court considered that there as sufficient reason for condoning the delay.
REASONING,This Court cannot override the discretion exercised by the High Court and the matter cannot be reopened in these appeals.
REASONING,"The second objection is based on the fact that the decree holder was given a choice by the High Court to elect wheth er he would deposit the purchase money or have the sale set aside, and his counsel told the learned Judges on the 15th November, 1946 that his client wished to retain the property which he had purchased and pay the purchase money in cash."
REASONING,It is contended that in view of this statement it was not open to the appellant to contend that he need not pay any amount to the judgment debtors.
REASONING,"This objection also is entirely devoid of any substance,because there is nothing on record to show that the appellant has consented to be bound by the order of the High Court and waived his right to appeal against it by reason of the election."
REASONING,"The learned counsel for the respondents also contended that the sale should have been set aside by the 819 High Court because the permission given to the decreeholder on the 16th February, 1934, to bid and set off the decretal amount against the purchase price was confined to an earlier sale and did not extend to the sate which took place on the 16th March, 1935, after the upset price which had been originally fixed was reduced."
REASONING,"Personally, I am inclined to hold that the permission covered the sale in question, but in any case it is difficult to hold on the facts stated that there was any such material irregularity as would vitiate the sale."
REASONING,The precise argument which is put forward here was advanced in the Courts below but it did not find favour either with the Subordinate Judge or with the High Court.
REASONING,"Besides, the respondents cannot raise the point in these appeals because they have filed no appeal against the order of the High Court upholding the sale."
REASONING,"In these circumstances, I would allow the appeals, set aside the orders of the High Court and restore the order of the learned Subordinate Judge."
REASONING,There will however be no order as to costs in these appeals.
REASONING,"MUKHERJEA J. I concur in the judgment just now deliv ered by ray learned brother, Fazl Ali J., and there is nothing further which I can usefully add."
REASONING,"The facts which have cha given rise to these appeals and the questions for decision have been stated in the judgment just now pronounced by my learned brother Fazl Ali J. I wish to add only a few words on the main contention advanced for the respondents by their learned Advocate, Mr. V. Rangachari."
REASONING,"If by reason of the confirmation of sale and satisfac tion of the decree having been entered up, the title to the village had passed indefeasibly to the decreeholder, there was no longer any decree or decree debt to be scaled down."
REASONING,"If, however, the title did not pass, because it was still open to the respondents to attack the Court sale under Order XXI, rule 90, they were landholders of the village and, as such, they would 820 come within the scope of proviso (D) to section 3 of the Madras Agriculturists ' Relief Act, 1938, which enacts that a landholder who holds a village paying more than Rs. 100 as quit rent or jodi is not an agriculturist within the meaning of the Act."
REASONING,"The apparent inconsistency in the view taken by the High Court was recognised, if not conceded, by the learned coun sel."
REASONING,"In one view, there ,,as no longer any decree in respect of which the Agriculturists ' Relief Act could operate; and in the other view, the respondents could not take advantage of the Act, as their ownership of the village precluded them."
REASONING,"Faced with this dilemma, Mr. Rangachari urged a some what ingenious argument."
REASONING,He contended that though the.
REASONING,"title passed to the decree holder on the confirmation of sale and became vested in him from the date of the sale, the respo dents could still be regarded as having an interest in the village, as the sale was open or liable to challenge and the title 'of the decree holder was inchoate or incomplete."
REASONING,"There is, however, really no support for this position."
REASONING,"On confir mation, the title of the decree holder became absolute or complete."
REASONING,"If the sale was set aside, the title would revest in the judgment debtor."
REASONING,There is nothing like an equitable title in the decree holder which could be recognised for certain purposes and not recognised for others.
REASONING,"Under the Madras Act, ""agriculturist"" means ""a person who has a saleable interest in any agricultural or horticul tural land or one who holds interest in such land under a landholder as a tenant, ryot or undertenure holder."" Section 10, sub clause (i) of the Act provides that the right conferred on an agriculturist to have a debt scaled down will not apply to any person who, though an ""agriculturist"" as defined in the Act, did not on 1 10 1937 hold an interest in or a lease or sub lease of any land."
RPC,"After the sale in 1935, the only interest which the judgment debtors had in the village was to have the sale set aside, under the rele vant provisions of the Civil Procedure Code."
RPC,"This interest is not the interest contemplated by section 3, sub clause (ii) (a) & (b) of the Act which speaks of a 821 saleable interest or interest as a tenant, ryot or underten ure holder."
RPC,I agree in the conclusion reached by my learned broth er.
RPC,Appeals allowed.

JUDGE,The Judgment of the Court was deliv ered by KANIA C.J.
FACTS,The relevant facts are these.
FACTS,The respondents are a private limited company which was brought into existence to float various companies including cotton mills.
FACTS,"In November, 1932, the Basanti Cotton Mills Ltd. was incorporated and the respondents were appointed their managing agents."
FACTS,Their remuneration was fixed at a month ly allowance of Rs. 500 and a commission of 3 per cent.
FACTS,on all gross sales of goods manufactured by the Mills Company.
FACTS,The fixed monthly allowance was liable to be increased in the event of the capital of the company being increased.
FACTS,The details are immaterial.
FACTS,"It ap pears that certain hundis were drawn by one of the direc tors of the respondent company, acting in the capacity of the managing agents of the Mill Company, in the name of the Mill Company and the same were negotiated to others."
FACTS,The Nath Bank Ltd. claimed payment of these hundis.
FACTS,"The Mill Company repudiated its liability as it appeared from the books of the Mill Company that they had not the use of the sum of Rs. 1 80,000 claimed by the Nath Bank Ltd. under the hundis."
FACTS,"The Nath Bank Ltd. instituted four suits 1011 against the Mill Company, in two of which the respondent company were party defendants."
FACTS,"The Mill Company was advised to settle the suits and the respondent company entered into an agreement with the Mill Company, the material part of the terms of which runs as follows : ""Memorandum of Agreement made between the Calcutta Agency Limited of the one part and Basanti Cotton Mills Ltd. of the other part."
FACTS,"WHEREAS the Nath Bank Limited demanded from the Mills the payment of the sum of Rs. 1,80,000 and interest thereon AND WHEREAS the said Mills repudiated their liability in respect thereof as it appeared from the books of the said Mills that the said Mills did not have the use of the said sum of Rs. 1,80000 or any part thereof AND WHEREAS the said Nath Bank Ltd. thereupon instituted four suits in High Court being suit Nos."
FACTS,"1683, 1720, 1735 and 1757 of 1939 for the said aggregate sum of Rs. 1,80,000 and the interest thereon AND WHEREAS the said Mills have been advised to settle the said suits amicably AND WHEREAS the Calcutta Agency Limited by its Directors, S.N. Mitter or S.C. Mitter, having been and being still the Managing Agents of the said Mills have undertaken to reimburse the said Mills in respect of the decrees to be made in the said four suits in the manner hereinafter appearing NOW THESE PRESENTS WITNESS AND IT IS HEREBY AGREED AND DECLARED (i) That out of the commission of 3% payable by the said Mills to the said Agency under Regulation 131 of the Arti cles of Association of the Company, the Company shall have paramount lien on and deduct and set off a moiety thereof against any payment which the said Mills may make in respect of the decrees or any of them and/or costs of the said suits."
FACTS,(ii) The said moiety shall be one half of the commis sion so payable less such sum as the Directors of the Mills may from time to time allow to be deducted.
FACTS,""" Under the said agreement, the respondent company paid to the Mill Company Rs. 22,500made up of 1012 Rs. 18,107 as principal and Rs. 4,393 as interest in the accounting year."
STATUTE,The assessee company claimed this before the Income tax Appellate Tribunal as a deduction permitted under section 10 (2) (xv) of the Indian Income tax Act.
STATUTE,"The relevant part of that section runs as follows : ""10."
STATUTE,"(1) ""The tax shall be payable by an assessee under the head 'Profits and gains of business, profession or vocation ' in respect of the profits or gains of any busi ness, profession or vocation carried on by him ' (2) Such profits or gains shall be computed after making the following allowances, namely : (xv) any expenditure (not being in the nature of capital expenditure or personal expenses of the assessee) laid out or expended wholly and exclusively for the purpose of such business, profession or vocation."
STATUTE,"In the statement of the case submitted by the Tribunal after reciting the fact of the incorporation of the company and the terms of the compromise mentioned above, the argu ments urged on behalf of the assessee company have been recapitulated."
FACTS,"The first argument was that under the first proviso to section 7 of the Indian Income tax Act, this payment was liable to be exempted."
RLC,The Tribunal rejected that argument.
RLC,"On the reference, the High Court also reject ed the same and it was not presented before us."
ARG,"The next argument of the respondents was that in respect of Rs. 22,500 it was entitled to exemption under section 10(2) (xv) of the Income tax Act on the ground that the payment was an expenditure which was not in the nature of a capital expend iture or personal expenses of the applicant company but was an expenditure laid out wholly and exclusively for the purpose of its business."
FACTS,"They urged that if the applicant company did not agree to pay this amount, Basanti Cotton Mills Ltd. could have brought a suit against the company to realise this amount due on the hundis which would 1013 have exposed the applicant company to the public and in order to save themselves from the scandal and maintain the managing agency they agreed to 'the deduction of of certain amounts from the managing agency commission due to it and thereby brought it within the principles of the decision of Mitchell vs"
FACTS,B.W. Noble Ltd.(1) The Tribunal found as facts: (1) 'I?hat the applicant company agreed to pay off the decretal amount from the remuneration which they are enti tled to get from the Basanti Cotton Mills.
FACTS,(2) The decree was passed against the applicant company evidently for certain misfeasance committed by its directors and the applicant company agreed to pay it off from its remunera tion.
FACTS,(3) The books of account of Basanti Cotton Mills Ltd. would show that they were paying the applicant company in full its remuneration and the books of the applicant company also show that it was entitled to its remuneration in full.
FACTS,(4) In the circumstances the Tribunal held that the expendi ture was not laid out wholly and exclusively for the purpose of carrying on the business.
FACTS,"(5) Besides, the Tribunal was of the opinion that in this case it was not a revenue ex penditure at all."
FACTS,"As the payment had to be made towards liquidation of the decretal amount the Tribunal held, in the circumstances of this case, that it was a capital payment."
FACTS,On behalf of the respondent it was argued in the further alternative that the Privy Council decision in Raja Bijoy Singh Dudhuria 's case(2) would cover the present case.
RLC,That contention was rejected by the Tribunal.
RLC,This statement of the case prepared by the Incometax Tribunal and submitted to the High Court for its opinion was perused by the parties and they had no suggestions to make in respect of the same.
RLC,The statement of the case was thus settled with the knowledge and approval of the parties.
RLC,"When the matter came before the High Court, Mr. Mitra, who argued the case for the present respondents, as shown by the judgment of the High Court, urged as follows: "" If the applicant company had not agreed to pay the amount mentioned ; 1014 in the aforesaid agreement, then the Basanti Cotton Mills Ltd. would have sued the company for the realisation of the amounts due on the hundis and it seems that there would have been no defence to the action."
REASONING,"This would have subjected the applicant company to the danger of public exposure and in order to save itself from the scandal and in order to main tain the managing agency, the applicant company agreed to deduct certain amounts from the managing agency commission and therefore such expenditure came within section 10(2)(xv) of the Act."" The High Court thereafter noticed several cases including Mitchell 's case(1) and towards the close of the judgment delivered by Chatterjea J. observed as follows: ""In this case it is clear that the agreement was entered into with a view to avoid the publicity of an action against the managing agents and consequent exposure and scandal andin order to maintain the managing agency so that the company could carry on its business as before."
REASONING,The payment in question did not bring in any new assets into existence nor in my opinion can it properly be said that it brought into existence an advantage for the enduring benefit of the company 's trade.
REASONING,The Appellate Tribunal observed that the decree was evidently passed against the appellant compa ny forcertain misfeasance by its directors and the appellant company agreed to pay it off from its remuneration .
REASONING,The object of the agreement was to enable the company to remove a defect in carrying on the business of the company and to earn profits in its business.
PRECEDENT,"Therefore this case is covered by the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Mitchell ' scase(1) . ""Applying this line of reasoning the High Court differed from the conclusion of the Tribunal and allowed the deduction to the respondent company under sec tion 10(2) (xv) of the Income tax Act, as claimed by the respondents."
PRECEDENT,"The Commissioner of Income tax, West Bengal, has come in appeal to us."
REASONING,"Now it is clear that this being a claim for exemption of an amount, contended to be an expenditure falling under section 10(2)(xv), the burden of proving the (1) ; 1015 necessary facts in that connection was on the assessee, it being common ground that the commission was due and had become payable and was therefore the business income of the assessee company liable to be taxed in the assessment year."
REASONING,"The jurisdiction of the High Court in the matter of income tax references is an advisory jurisdiction and under the Act the decision of the Tribunal on facts is final, unless it can be successfully assailed on the ground that there was no evidence for the conclusions on facts recorded by the Tribu nal."
REASONING,It is therefore the duty of the High Court to start by looking at the facts found by the Tribunal and answer the questions of law on that footing.
REASONING,"Any departure from this rule of law will convert the High Court into a fact finding authority, which it is not under the advisory jurisdiction."
REASONING,The statement of the case under the rules framed under the Income tax Act is prepared with the knowledge of the parties concerned and they have a full opportunity to apply for any addition or deletion from that statement of the case.
REASONING,If they approved of that statement that is the agreed statement of facts by the parties on which the High Court has to pronounce its judgment.
REASONING,In the present case the parties perused the statement of case and as disclosed by the note made at the end of it had no suggestions to make in respect thereof.
REASONING,It is therefore clear that it was the duty of the High Court to start with that statement of the case as the final statement of facts.
REASONING,"Surprisingly, we find that the High Court, in its judgment, has taken the argument of Mr. Mitra as if they were facts and have based their conclusion solely on that argument."
REASONING,"Nowhere in the statement of the case prepared by the Tribunal and filed in the High Court, the Tribunal had come to the conclusion that the payment was made by the assessee company to avoid any danger of public exposure or to save itself from scandal or in order to maintain the managing agency of the appellant company."
REASONING,The whole conclusion of the High Court is based on this unwar ranted assumption of facts which are taken only from the argument of counsel for the present respondents before 1016 the High Court.
REASONING,The danger of failing to recognise that the jurisdiction of the High Court in these matters is only advisory and the conclusions of the Tribunal on facts are the conclusions on which the High Court is to exercise such advisory jurisdiction is illustrated by this case.
REASONING,"It seems that unfortunately counsel for the respondents caught hold of Mitchell 's case(1) and basing his argument on the circum stances under which a payment could be described as a busi ness expenditure falling within the terms of section 10 (2) (xv), argued that the facts in the present case were the same."
REASONING,"Instead of first ascertaining what were the facts found by the Tribunal in the present case, the process was reversed and the procedure adopted was to take Mitchell 's case(1) as the law and argue that the facts in the present case covered the situation."
REASONING,1n our opinion this is an entirely wrong approach and should not have been permitted by the High Court.
REASONING,The High Court fell into a grave error in omitting first to ascertain what were the facts found in the case stated by the Tribunal.
REASONING,The High Court overlooked that in Mitchell 's case(1) the whole discussion started with a quotation from the case stated by the Commissioners as the facts of the case.
REASONING,"A scrutiny of the record in the present case shows that before the Income tax Officer the assessees claimed only a deduction of the interest of Rs. 5,582 as a permissible deduction under section 10 (2) (iii) of the Income tax Act."
REASONING,That claim was rejected by the Income tax Officer.
REASONING,"When the matter went to the Assistant Income tax Commissioner it was argued that the Income tax Officer was in error in not allowing the deduction of interest and was also wrong in not allowing the entire sum of Rs. 22,500 as a deduction on the ground that portion of the income (viz., Rs. 22,500) should be treated as not earned or deemed to be earned by the assessees at all, having regard to the decision of the Privy Council in Raja Bijoy Singh Dudhuria 's case(2) The first paragraph of the order of the Appellate Assistant Commis sioner contains the following 1017 statement : "" In disallowing this (interest) c]aim the Income tax Officer was following the decision of my prede cessor in his order dated the 18th March 1942 in Appeal No. 1 C 11 of 1941 42."
REASONING,"My predecessor observed: ""Nothing is in evidence to show that the managing agency company had sur plus money and such money was invested or that there was any need to borrow."
REASONING,Thus the need to borrow is not established.
REASONING,"There is no doubt that money was borrowed but unless it can to proved that the borrowing is for the purpose of the business and the loan was used in the business, the interest cannot be allowed under section 10(2)(iii)."
REASONING,""" The second objection raised before the Appellate Assist ant Commissioner was in these terms : "" That the Income tax Officer should have allowed the said sum of Rs. 22,500 as allowable expenditure being allocation of a sum out of the revenue receipt before it became income in the hands of the assessee."
REASONING,""" The wording of the objection and the argument noticed in the order of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner show that the contention was that this sum should be treated as not having become the income of the assessee at all because it was deducted at the source by the Mill company."
PRECEDENT,Reliance was placed for this contention on Raja Bijoy Singh Dudhuria 's case(1).
PRECEDENT,The contention was rejected.
REASONING,"At the third stage, when the assessee urged his contentions before the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, he thought of urging as an argument that this was a permissible deduction under section 10 (2)(xv) because of the principles laid down in Mitchell 's case(2)."
REASONING,"No evidence, it appears, was led before the Income Tax Tribunal, nor has the Tribunal recorded any findings of fact on which the principles laid down in Mitch ell 's case(2) could be applied."
REASONING,The Tribunal 's conclusions of facts were only as summarized in the earlier part of the judgment.
REASONING,"It is therefore clear that the necessary facts required to be established before the principles laid down in MiZchell 's case( '2) could be applied, have not been found as facts in the present case at any stage of the proceedings and the High Court was in error (1) (2) ; 130 1018 in applying the principles of Mitchell 's case(1) on the assumption of facts which were not proved."
REASONING,"The High Court was carried away, it seems, by the argument of the coun sel and through error accepted the argument as facts."
REASONING,"Indeed, if it had noticed the contention urged before the Income tax Officer it would have seen at once that the argument was in a measure conflicting with that contention which was based on the footing of Rs. 1,80,000 being a loan to the assessee on which it had to pay interest, which was sought to be deducted under section 10 (2) (iii) of the Income tax Act."
RPC,"In our opinion, therefore, this appeal should be allowed on the simple ground that the facts neces sary to be established by the respondents to support their claim for exemption under section 10(2)(xv)of the Indian Income tax Act have not been established at any stage of the proceedings and therefore they are not entitled to the deduction claimed."
RPC,The appeal is therefore allowed with costs here and before the High Court.

COUNSEL,"S.K. Mitra (section L. Chibber, with him) for the respondent."
JUDGE,The judgment of the Court was deliv ered by FAzL ALl J.
FACTS,"This is an appeal from an order of the High Court of Judicature at Patna dated the 9th September, 1948, declining to call upon the board of Revenue to state a case under section 21 (3) of the Bihar Sales Tax Act, 1944 (Act VI of 1944), with reference to an assessment made under that Act."
STATUTE,"The Bihar Sales Tax Act was passed in 1944, and section 4 of the Act provides that ""every dealer whose gross turn over during the year immediately preceding the commencement of the Act exceeded Rs. 5,000 shall be liable to pay tax under the Act on sales effected after the date so notified."
FACTS,""" It is not disputed that, having regard to the definitions of dealer, goods and sale under the Act, the appellant, who has been doing contract work on a fairly extensive scale for the Central Public Works Department and the East Indian Railway, comes within the category of a dealer mentioned in section 4."
STATUTE,"Section 7 of the Act provides that ""no dealer shall, while being liable under section 4 to pay tax under the Act, carry on business as a dealer unless he has been registered under the Act and possesses a registration certificate""."
FACTS,"In pursuance of this provision, the appellant filed an applica tion for registration on the 19th December, 1944, and a certificate of registration was issued to him on the 21st December, 1944."
FACTS,"On the 8th October, 1945, the Sales Tax Officer issued a notice to the appellant asking him to produce his accounts on 10th November, 1945, and to show cause why in addition to the tax to be finally assessed on him a penalty not exceeding one and a half times the amount should not be imposed on him under section 10 (5) of the Act."
STATUTE,"Section 10 (5), under which the notice purported to have been issued, runs thus: ""If upon information which has come into his posses sion, the Commissioner is satisfied that any dealer has been liable to pay tax under this Act in respect of any period and has nevertheless wilfully failed to apply for registra tion, the Commissioner shall, alter giving the dealer a reasonable opportunity of being heard, assess, to the best of his judgment, the amount of tax, if any, due from the dealer in respect of such 801 period and all subsequent periods and the Commissioner may direct that the dealer shall pay, 'by way of, penalty, in addition to the amount so assessed, a sum not exceeding one and a half times that amount."
FACTS,""" The appellant appeared before the Sales Tax Officer in response to this notice, but obtained several adjournments till 16th March, 1046, and ultimately failed to appear."
FACTS,"Thereupon, he was assessed by the Sales Tax Officer, accord ing to the best of his judgment, and was ordered to pay Rs. 4,526 13 0 as tax and a penalty amounting to one and a half times the amount assessed, under section 10 (5) of the Act."
FACTS,"The appellant appealed to the Commissioner against the assessment and the penalty levied upon him, but his appeal was dismissed on the 6th June, 1946."
FACTS,"He then filed a peti tion for revision to the Board of Revenue, against the order of the Commissioner, but it was dismissed on the 28th May, 1947."
FACTS,"He thereupon moved the Board of Revenue to refer to the High Court certain questions of law arising out of is order of the 28th May, but Mr. N. Baksi, a Member of the Board, by his order of the 4th December, 1947, rejected the petition with the following observations : ""No case for review of my predecessor 's order made out."
FACTS,No reference necessary.
STATUTE,""" Section 21 of the Act provides that if the Board of Revenue refuses to make a reference to the High Court, the applicant may apply to the High Court against such refusal, and the High Court, if it is not satisfied that such refusal was justified, may require the Board of Revenue to state a case and refer it to the High Court."
STATUTE,"The section also provides that ""the High Court upon the hearing of any such case shall decide the question of law raised thereby, and shall deliver its judgment thereon containing the grounds on which such decision is founded, and shall send to the Board of Revenue a copy of such judg ment under the seal of the Court . . and the Board shall dispose of the case accordingly."
STATUTE,""" In accordance with this section, the appellant made an application to the High Court praying that the Board of Revenue may be called upon to state a case and refer 802 it to the High Court."
RLC,"Dealing with this application, the High Court pointed out that the Member of the Board had not been asked to review his predecessor 's order but only to state a case, and gave the following directions : ""The ease must, therefore, go back to the Board of Revenue for a case to be stated or for a proper ,order rejecting the application to be passed."" The Board then reheard the matter and rejected the application of the appellant and refused to state a case and refer it to the High Court."
RLC,"The appellant thereafter made an application to the High Court for requiring the Board of Revenue to state a case, but this application was summarily rejected."
RLC,"He then applied to the High Court for leave to appeal to the Federal Court, which the High Court granted, following the decision of a Full Bench of the Lahore High Court in Feroze Shah Kaka Khd vs Income tax Commissioner, punjab and N.W.F.P., Lahore The High Court pointed out in the order granting leave that in the appeal that was taken to the Privy Council in the Lahore case, an objection had been raised as to the competency of the appeal, but the Privy Council, while dismissing the appeal on the merits, had made the following observation: "" The objection is a serious one."
REASONING,Admittedly such an appeal as the present is not authorized by the Income tax Act itself.
REASONING,"If open at all, it must be justified under clause ""9, Letters Patent of the Lahore High Court, as being an appeal from a final judgment, decree or order made in the exercise of original jurisdiction by a Division Bench of the High Court."
RLC,And this present appeal was held by the Full Court to be so justified.
RLC,"Before the Board the question was not fully argued, and their Lordships accordingly refrain from expressing any opinion whatever upon it"" (2)."
RLC,The High Court in granting leave to the appellant seems to have been influenced mainly by the fact that the view of the Lahore High Court had not been held by the Privy Council to be wrong.
FACTS,"803 At the commencement of the hearing of the appeal in this Court, a preliminary objection was raised by the learned counsel for the respondent that this appeals was not compe tent, and, on hearing both the parties, we are of the opin ion that the objection is wellfounded."
PRECEDENT,"In Sri Mahanth Harihar Gir vs Commissioner of Income tax, Bihar and Orissa (1) it was held by a special Bench of the Patna High Court that no appeal lay to His Majesty in Council under clause 31 of the Letters Patent of the Patna High Court, from an order of the High Court dismissing an application under section 66 (3) of the Income tax Act, (a provision similar to section 21 of the Act before us) to direct the Commissioner of Income tax to state a case."
PRECEDENT,"In that case, the whole law on the subject has been clearly and exhaustively dealt with, and it has been pointed out that the view taken by the Full Bench of the Lahore High Court in the case cited by the appellant was not supported by sever al other High Courts and that the Privy Council also, when the matter came before it, refrained from expressing any opinion as to its correctness."
REASONING,"In our opinion, the view expressed in the Patna case is correct."
REASONING,"Clause 31 of the Letters Patent of the Patna High Court, on the strength of which the appellant resists the prelimi nary objection raised by the respondent, runs thus : ""And We do further ordain that any person or persons may appeal to Us, Our heirs and successors, in Our or Their Privy Council, in any matter not being of criminal juris diction, from any final judgment, decree, or order of the said High Court of Judicature at Patna, made on appeal and from any final judgment, decree on order made in the exercise of original jurisdiction by Judges of the said High Court or of any Division Court, from which an appeal does not lie to the said High Court under the provisions contained in the 10th clause of these (1) A.I.R. 1941 Prat."
REASONING,"804 presents: provided, in either case, that the sum or matter at issue is of the amount or value of not less than ten thousand rupees, or that such judgment,decree or order involves, directly or indirectly, some claim, demand or question to or respecting property amounting to or of the value of not less than ten thousand rupees; or from any other final judgment, aecree or order made either on appeal or otherwise as aforesaid, when the said High Court declares that the case is a fit one for appeal to Us . "" In order to attract the provisions of this clause, it is necessary to show, firstly, that the order under appeal is a final order; and secondly, that it was passed in the exer cise of the original or appellate jurisdiction of the High Court."
REASONING,The second requirement clearly follows from the concluding part of the clause.
REASONING,"It seems to us that the order appealed against in this case, cannot be regarded as a final order, because it does not of its own force bind or affect the rights of the parties."
STATUTE,All that the High Court is required to do under section 21 of the Bihar Sales Tax Act is to decide the question of law raised and send a copy of its judgment to the Board of Revenue.
REASONING,The Board of Revenue then has to dispose of the case in the light of the judgment of the High Court.
REASONING,"It is true that the Board 's order is based on what is stated by the High Court to be the correct legal position, but the fact remains that the order of the High Court standing by itself does not affect the rights of the parties, and the final order in the matter is the order which is passed ultimately by the Board of Revenue."
PRECEDENT,"This question has been fully dealt with in Tata Iron and Steel Company vs Chief Revenue Authority, Bombay(1), where Lord Atkinson pointed out that the order made by the High Court was merely advisory and quoted the following observations of Lord Esher in In re Knight and the Tabernacle Permanent Building Society(2): ""In the case of Ex parte County Council of Kent, where a statute provided that a case might be stated (1) at 617. 805 for the decision of the Court it was held that though the language might prima facie import that there has to be the equivalent of a judgment or order, yet when the context was looked at it appeared that the jurisdiction of the Court appealed to was only consultative, and that there was noth ing which amounted to a judgment or order."
REASONING,""" It cannot also be held that the order was passed by the High Court in this case in the exercise of either original or appellate jurisdiction."
REASONING,"It is not contended that the matter arose in the exercise of the appellate jurisdiction of the High Court, because there was no appeal before it."
REASONING,"Nor can the matter, properly speaking, be said to have arisen in the exercise of the original jurisdiction of the High Court, as was held by the Judges of the Lahore High Court in the case to which reference was made, because the proceeding did not commence in the High Court as all origi nal suits and proceedings should commence."
REASONING,But the High Court acquired jurisdiction to deal with the case by virtue of an express provision of the Bihar Sales Tax Act.
REASONING,The crux of the matter therefore is that the jurisdiction of the High Court was only consultative and was neither original nor appellate.
REASONING,"In this view, the appeal must be dismissed, though on hearing the parties, it appeared to us that the salestax authorities including the Commissioner and the Board of Revenue were in error in imposing a penalty upon the appel lant under section 10 15) of the Act which had no applica tion to his case, inasmuch as he had been registered as required by section 7 of the Act."
RPC,"In the circumstances, while dismissing the appeal, we make no order as to costs."
RPC,Appeal dismissed.

FACTS,"Rani having died subsequently, Mst."
FACTS,Mithani came to hold the entire estate of her husband in the restricted rights of a Hindu widow.
FACTS,"On 27th November 1919, Mst."
FACTS,Mithani surrendered the whole estate of her husband by a deed of gift in favour of Thakur Prasad who was the nearest reversioner at that time.
FACTS,"Thakur Prasad died in 1921, leaving a minor son named Nand Lal who succeeded to his properties and this Nand Lal is the plain tiff in the suit out of which this appeal arises."
FACTS,"On 27th October 1921, there was a transaction entered into between Babu Ram on his own behalf as well as guardian of infant Nand Lal on the One hand and Mst."
FACTS,"Meria, the widow of Chhedi Lal, on 769 the other, by which two items of property which are the subject matter of the present litigation were conveyed to Meria by a deed of transfer which has been described as a Tamliknama; and she on her part executed a deed of relin quishment renouncing her claims to every portion of the estate left by Mangal Sen."
FACTS,"It is not disputed that Meria took possession of the properties on the basis of the Tam liknama and on 10th April 1923 she executed a will, by which these properties were bequeathed to her three nephews, who are the sons of her brother Sunder Lal."
FACTS,Meria died on 19th June 1924.
FACTS,"One Ram Dayal had obtained a money decree against Sunder Lal and his three sons, and in execution of that decree the properties in suit were attached and put up to sale and they were purchased by Ram Dayal himself on 30th January 1934."
FACTS,"On 1st June 1936, the present suit was insti tuted by Nand Lal and he prayed for recovery of possession of these two items of property on the allegation that as they were given to Mst."
FACTS,"Meria for her maintenance and resi dence, she could enjoy the same only so long as she lived and after her death, they reverted to the plaintiff."
FACTS,"Sunder Lal, the brother of Meria, was made the first defendant in the suit, and his three sons figured as defendants Nos."
FACTS,2 to 4.
FACTS,Defendant No. 5 is a lady named Chimman Kunwar in whose favour Sunder Lal was alleged to have executed a deed of transfer in respect of a portion of the disputed proper ty.
FACTS,"Ram Dayal, the decree holder auction purchaser, died in May 1935 and his properties vested in his daughter 's son Ram Gopal under a deed of gift executed by him in favour of the latter."

FACTS,"The two other defendants, namely, defendants 7 and 8, who were also made parties at the same time, are respectively the widow and an alleged adopted son of Ram Dayal."
FACTS,"The suit was contested primarily by defendant No. 6, and the substantial contentions raised by him in his written statement were of a two fold character."
FACTS,770 The first and the main contention was that Mst.
FACTS,"Meria got an absolute title to the disputed properties on the strength of the 'Tamliknama ' executed in her favour by the guardian of the plaintiff and after her death, the properties passed on to the three sons of Sunder Lal who were the legatees under her will."
FACTS,"Ram Dayal, it was said, having purchased these properties execution of a money decree against Sunder Lal and his three sons acquired a valid title to them."
FACTS,The other contention raised was that the suit was barred by limitation.
RLC,The trial Judge decided both these points in favour of the contesting defendant and dismissed the plain tiff 's suit.
RLC,"On appeal to the High Court, the judgment of the Civil Judge was set aside and the plaintiff 's suit was decreed."
ARG,"The first point raised by Mr. Banerjee turns upon the construction to be placed upon the document executed by Babu Ram on his own behalf as well as on behalf of Nand Lal then an infant, by which the properties in dispute were trans ferred to Mst."
FACTS,"It begins by a recital of the events under which Nand Lal became the sole owner of the properties left by Mangal Sen and refers in this connection to the obligation on the part of both Babu Ram and Nand Lal to ""support, maintain and console"" Mst."
FACTS,"Meria, the widow of the pre deceased son of Mangal Sen."
FACTS,"The document then proceeds to state as follows: ""I have therefore, of my own accord and free will without any compulsion or coercion on the part of any one else while in my proper senses made a Tamlik of a double storied pucca built shop . and a house 771 and a kothri in Etawah . . worth Rs. 8,000 for purposes of residence of the Musammat, owned by the minor aforesaid . which at present stands let out on rent to Sunder Lal, brother of Mst."
FACTS,Meria aforesaid . . in favour of Mst.
FACTS,"Meria aforesaid, widow of Chhedi Lal and made her the owner (Malik)."
FACTS,"If any portion or the whole of the property made a Tamlik of for the purpose mentioned above passes out of the possession of the Musammat aforesaid on account of the claim of Nand Lal minor aforesaid, I and my property of every sort shall be responsible and liable for the same."
FACTS,""" This document has got to be read along with the deed of relinquishment, which is a contemporaneous document execut ed by Meria renouncing all her claims to the property left by Mangal Sen."
FACTS,"The deed of relinquishment like the Tamliknama recites elaborately, with reference to previous events, particularly to the deed of gift executed by Mst."
FACTS,"Mithani in favour of Thakur Prasad, the gradual devolution of the entire estate of Mangal Sen upon Nand Lal."
FACTS,"It states thereafter that Babu Ram, as the guardian of the minor and also in his own right, ""has under a Tamliknama dated this day made a 'Tamlik '."
FACTS,"in my favour of a shop alongwith a Balakhana and a kota for my maintenance and a house . . for purpose of my residence which are quite sufficient for my maintenance."" ""I have therefore, of my own accord "", the document goes on to say, ""made a relinquishment of the entire property aforesaid mentioned in the deed of gift . worth Rs. 25,000."
FACTS,"I do covenant and do give in writing that I have and shall have no claim to or concern with the property . . belonging to the minor afore said, nor has the property aforesaid remained subject to my maintenance allowance nor shall I bring any claim at any time."
FACTS,""" The schedule to the instrument, it may be noted, gives a list of all the properties of Mangal Sen in respect to which Mst."
FACTS,"Mithani executed a deed of gift in favour of Thakur Prasad, including the two items of property covered by the 'Tamliknama ' mentioned aforesaid."
FACTS,"772 In construing a document whether in English or in vernacular the fundamental rule is to ascertain the inten tion from the words used; the surrounding circumstances are to be considered, but that is only for the purpose of finding out the intended meaning of the words which have actually been employed(1)."
FACTS,In the present case the instru ment of grant has been described as a 'Tamliknama ' which means a document by which ' Maliki ' or ownership rights are transferred and the document expressly says that the grantee has been made a ' Malik ' or owner.
FACTS,"There are no express words making the gift heritable and transferable; nor on the other hand, is there any statement that the transferee would enjoy the properties only during her life time and that they would revert to the grantor after her death."
FACTS,"It may be taken to be quite settled that there is no warrant for the proposition of law that when a grant of an immovable property is made to a Hindu female, she does not get an absolute or alienable interest in such property, unless such power is expressly conferred upon her."
PRECEDENT,"The reasoning adopted by Mr. Justice Mitter of the Calcutta High Court in Kollani Koer vs Luchmee Parsad(2) which was ap proved of and accepted by the Judicial Committee in a number of decisions, seems to me to be unassailable."
PRECEDENT,"It was held by the Privy Council as early as in the case of Tagore vs Tagore( '3) that if an estate were given to a man without express words of inheritance, it would, in the absence of a conflicting context, carry, by Hindu Law, an estate of inheritance."
STATUTE,"This is the general principle of law which is recognised and embodied in section 8 of the Transfer of Property Act and unless it is shown that under Hindu Law a gift to a female means a limited gift or carries with it the restrictions or disabilities similar to those that exist in a 'widow 's estate ', there is no justification for departing from this principle."
PRECEDENT,(1) Vide Rajgndra Prasad vs Gopal Prasad.
REASONING,"773 The position, therefore, is that to convey an absolute estate to a Hindu female, no express power of alienation need be given; it is enough if words are used of such ampli tude as would convey full rights of ownership."
REASONING,Mr. Banerjee naturally lays stress upon the description of the document as 'Tamliknama ' and the use of the word ' Malik ' or owner in reference to the interest which it pur ports to convey to the transferee.
REASONING,The word ' Malik ' is of very common use in many parts of India and it cannot cer tainly be regarded as a technical term of conveyancing.
REASONING,"In the language of the Privy Council, the term 'Malik ' when used in a will or other document ""as descriptive of the position which a devisee or donee is intended to hold, has been held apt to describe an owner possessed of full pro prietory rights, including a full right of alienation, unless there is something in the context or in the surround ing circumstances to indicate that such full proprietory rights were not intended to be conferred(1). ' ' This I think to be a perfectly correct statement of law and I only desire to add that it should be taken with the caution which the Judicial Committee uttered in course of the same observa tion that ""the meaning of every word in an Indian document must always depend upon the setting in which it is placed, the subject to which it is related and the locality of the grantor from which it receives its true shade of meaning."
RLC,The High Court in reaching its decision adverse to the appellant laid great stress on the fact that the grant was expressed to be for maintenance and residence of Mst.
REASONING,"This, it is said, would prima facie indicate that the grant was to enure for the lifetime of the grantee."
PRECEDENT,"It is pointed out by the learned (1) Vide Sasiman Chowdhurain vs Shib Narayan, 49 I.A, 25."
REASONING,99 774 Judges that the language of the document does not show that anybody else besides the lady herself was to be benefited by the grant and the indemnity given by Babu Ram was also given to the lady personally.
REASONING,"It is further said that if Meria was given an absolute estate in the properties comprised in the 'Tamliknama ', there was no necessity for including these two properties again in the deed of relinquishment which she executed at the same time."
REASONING,"I do not think that the mere fact that the gift of property is made for the support and maintenance of a female relation could be taken to be a prima facie indication of the intention of the donor, that the donee was to enjoy the property only during her life time."
REASONING,"The extent of interest, which the donee is to take, depends upon the intention of the donor as expressed by the language use, d, and if the dispositive words employed in the document are clear and unambiguous and import absolute ownership, the purpose of the grant would not, by itself, restrict or cut down the interest."
REASONING,"The desire to provide maintenance or residence of the donee would only show the motive which prompted the donor to make the gift, but it could not be read as a meas ure of the extent of the gift."
PRECEDENT,This was laid down in clear terms by the Judicial Committee in a comparatively recent case which is to be found reported in Bishunath Prasad vs Chandrika(1).
REASONING,"There a Hindu executed a registered deed of gift of certain properties in favour of his daughter in law for the"" support and maintenance"" of his daughter in law and declared that the donee should remain absolute owner of the property (malik mustaqil) and pay Government revenue."
REASONING,There were no words in the document expressly making the interest heritable or conferring on the donee the power of making alienation.
REASONING,"It was held by the Judicial Committee that the donee took under the document, an absolute estate with powers to make alienation giving title valid after her death."
REASONING,"In course of the judgment, Lord Blanesburgh quoted, with approval, an earlier decision of the (1) 60 I.A 56 775 Judicial Committee, where the words ""for your maintenance"" occurring in a deed of gift were held insufficient to cut down to life interest the estate taken by the donees."
REASONING,"These words, it was said, ""are quite capable of signifying that the gift was made for the purpose of enabling them to live in comfort and do not necessarily mean that it was to be limited to a bare right of maintenance."
PRECEDENT,""" On behalf of the respondent, reliance was placed upon the decision of the Judicial Committee in Raja Ram Buksh vs Arjun(1)in support of the contention that in a maintenance grant it is the prima facie intention of the gift that it should be for life."
REASONING,"In my opinion, the decision cited is no authority for the general proposition as is contended for by the learned Counsel for the respondent, and it is to be read in the context of the actual facts of the case which relate to grants of a particular type with special features of its own."
REASONING,It was a case where a Talukdar made a grant of certain villages to a junior member of the joint family for mainte nance of the latter.
REASONING,The family was governed by the law of primegeniture and the estate descended to a single heir.
REASONING,"In such cases the usual custom is that the junior members of the family, who can get no share in the property, are enti tled to provisions by way of maintenance for which assign ments of lands are generally made in their favour."
REASONING,"The extent of interest taken by the grantee in the assigned lands depends entirely upon the circumstances of the partic ular case, or rather upon the usage that prevails in the particular family."
REASONING,In the case before the Privy Council there was actually no deed of transfer.
REASONING,"It was an oral assignment made by the Talukdar, and the nature of the grant had to be determined upon the recitals of a petition for mutation of names made to the Revenue Department by the grantor after the verbal assignment was made and from other facts and circumstances of the case."
PRECEDENT,"The case of Woodoya ditta Deb vs Mukoond(2), which was referred to and relied upon in the judgment of the Privy Council, was (1) 28 I.A, 1."
REASONING,"776 also a case of maintenance or khor phos grant made in favour of a junior member of the family, where theestate was im partible and descended under the rules of primogeniture."
REASONING,"It was held in that case that such grants, the object of which was to make suitable provisions for the immediate members of the family, were by their very nature and also under the custom of the land resumable by the zemindar on the death of the grantee, as otherwise the whole zemindary would be swallowed up by continual demands."
REASONING,"This principle bas obviously no application to cases of the type which we have before us and it was never so applied by the Privy Council, as would appear from the decision referred to above."
REASONING,"The learned Counsel for the plaintiff respondent drew our attention in this connection, to the fact that the properties given by the ,Tamliknama ' were valued at Rs. 8,000, whereas the entire estate left by Mangal Sen was worth Rs. 25,000 only."
REASONING,"It is argued that the transfer of nearly one third of the entire estate in absolute right to one who was entitled to maintenance merely, is, on the face of it, against probability and common sense."
REASONING,"I do not think that, on the facts of this case, any weight could be at tached to this argument."
REASONING,"In the first place, it is to be noted that whatever might have been the actual market value of the properties, what the widow got under the Tamliknama was a residential house and a shop, and the shop was the only property which fetched any income."
REASONING,"This shop, it appears, was all along in possession of Sunder Lal, the brother of Meria, and the rent, which he paid or promised to pay in respect of the same, was only Rs. 12 a month."
REASONING,"So from the income of this property it was hardly possible for Meria to have even abate maintenance, and this would rather support the inference that the properties were given to her absolutely and not for enjoyment merely, so long as she lived."
REASONING,"But what is more important is, that the object of creating these two documents, as the surrounding circumstances show, was not merely to make provision 777 for the maintenance of Mst."
REASONING,Meria; the other and the more important object was to perfect the title of Nand Lal to the estate left by Mangal Sen and to quiet all disputes that freight arise in respect of the same.
REASONING,It may be that Mst.
REASONING,"Meria could not, in law, claim any."
REASONING,thing more than a right to be maintained out of the estate of her deceased father in law.
REASONING,"But it is clear that whatever her legal rights might have been, Nand Lal 's own position as the sole owner of the properties left by Mangal Sen was not altogeth er undisputed or free from any hostile attack."
REASONING,"As has been said already, Sunder Lal, the brother of Meria, was in occupation of the double storied shop from long before the Tamliknama was executed and Meria got any legal title to it."
REASONING,It appears from the record that in 1920 a suit was institut ed on behalf of the infant Nand Lal for evicting Sunder Lal from the shop and the allegation in the plaint was that Sunder Lal was occupying the property as a tenant since the time of Mst.
REASONING,Mithani by taking a settlement from her.
REASONING,Sunder Lal in his written statement filed in that suit expressly repudiated the allegation of tenancy and also the title of Nand Lal and openly asserted that it was Mst.
REASONING,Meria who was the actual owner of Mangal Sen 's estate.
REASONING,"The suit ended in a compromise arrived at through the medium of arbitrators and the result was that although Sunder Lal admitted the title of the plaintiff, the latter had to abandon the claims which were made in the plaint for rents, costs and damages."
REASONING,Sunder Lal continued to be in occupation of the shop and executed a rent agreement in respect of the same in favour of Nand Lal promising to pay a rent of Rs. 12 per month.
REASONING,"A few months later, the Tamliknama was executed and this shop along with the residential house were given to Meria in maliki right."
REASONING,"The recitals in both the Tamliknama and the deed of relin quishment clearly indicate that the supreme anxiety on the part of Babu Ram, who was trying his best to safeguard the interests of the minor, was to put an end to all further disputes that might be raised by or on behalf of Mst."
REASONING,Meria with regard to the rights of Nand Lal to the properties 778 of Mangal Sen and to make his title to the same absolutely impeccable.
REASONING,That seems to be the reason why Meria was given a comparatively large portion of the properties left by Mangal Sen which would enable her to live in comfort and her interest was not limited to a bare right of mainte nance.
REASONING,"It is significant to note that the shop room, which was all along in possession of Sunder Lal, was included in this Tamliknama and soon after the grant was made, Sunder Lal executed a rent agreement in respect of the shop in favour of Mst."
REASONING,Meria acknowledging her to be the owner of the property.
REASONING,"It is true that the document does not make any reference to the heirs of Meria, but that is not at all necessary, nor is it essential that any express power of alienation should be given."
REASONING,"The word ""Malik"" is too common an expres sion in this part of the country and its meaning and impli cations were fairly well settled by judicial pronouncements long before the document was executed."
REASONING,"If really the grantee was intended to have only a life interest in the properties, there was no lack of appropriate words, per fectly well known in the locality, to express such inten tion."
REASONING,The High Court seems to have been influenced to some extent by the fact that in the Tamliknama there was a guarantee given by Babu Ram to Meria herself and to no one else agreeing to compensate her in case she was dispossessed from the properties at the instance of Nand Lal.
REASONING,This covenant in the document was in the nature of a personal guarantee given by Babu Ram to Mst.
REASONING,Meria for the simple reason that the property belonged to an infant and it was as guardian of the minor that Babu Ram was purporting to act.
REASONING,It was too much to expect that Babu Ram would bind himself for all time to come and give a guarantee to the future heirs of Meria as well.
REASONING,Probably no such thing was contem plated by the parties and no such undertaking was insisted upon by the other side.
REASONING,"But whatever the reason might be which led to the covenant being expressed in this particu lar form, I do not think that it has even a remote bearing on the 779 question that arises for our consideration in the present case."
REASONING,"It is of no assistance to the plaintiff in support of the construction that is sought to be put upon the , docu ment on his behalf."
REASONING,"I am also not at all impressed by the other fact re ferred to in the judgment of the High Court that if the properties were given to Meria in absolute right, there was no necessity for including them again in the schedule to the deed of relinquishment which Meria executed."
REASONING,I fail to see how the inclusion of the properties in the deed of relin quishment would go to indicate that Meria 's rights to these properties were of a restricted and not an absolute charac ter.
REASONING,It is after all a pure matter of conveyancing and the two documents have to be read together as parts of one and the same ' transaction.
REASONING,"Under the ' Tamliknama ', Meria got two properties in absolute right out of the estate of Mangal Sen."
REASONING,"By the deed of relinquishment, she renounced her claim for maintenance in respect of all the properties left by Mangal Sen including the two items which she got under the 'Tamliknama '."
REASONING,"After the ' Tamliknama ' was executed in her favour, there Was no further question of her claiming any right of maintenance in respect of these two items of property."
REASONING,She became the absolute owner thereof in exchange of her rights of maintenance over the entire estate and this right of maintenance she gave up by the deed of relinquish ment.
REASONING,"On a construction of the entire document, my conclu sion is that there is nothing in the context of the docu ment, or in the surrounding circumstances which would dis place the presumption of full proprietory rights which the use of the word ""Malik"" is apt ordinarily to convey."
REASONING,"The first contention of the appellant, therefore, succeeds and in view of my decision on this point, the second question does not arise for determination at all."
RPC,"The result is that the appeal is allowed, the judgment and decree of the High Court are set aside and those of the trial Judge restored."
RPC,The defendant No. 6 will have his costs from the plaintiff in all the courts.
RPC,There will be no order for costs as regards the other parties: 780 FAZL ALI J.
RPC,"I agree with the judgment delivered by my learned brother, Mukherjea J. CHANDRASEKHARA AIYAR J."
RPC,During the hearing of the appeal I entertained doubts whether the view taken by the High Court was not correct.
RPC,"But on further consideration, I find that it cannot be maintained, having regard to the terms of the ' Tamliknama ' (deed of transfer) in favour of Musammat Meria and the context in which it came into exist ence."
RPC,The name of the document or deed does not very much matter.
RPC,"Though the word ' malik ' is not a term of art, it has been held in quite a large number of cases, decided mostly by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, that the word, as employed in Indian documents, means absolute owner and that unless the context indicated a different meaning, its use would be sufficient to convey a full title even without the addition of the words, ' heirs ', or ' son ', ' grandson ' and ' great grandson '."
RPC,"Of course, if there are other clauses in the document which control the import of the word and restrict the estate to a limited one, we must give the narrower meaning; otherwise the word must receive its full significance."
PRECEDENT,"Especially is this so, when the rule of interpretation laid down in Mohammed Shamsul vs Sewak Ram( ') has come to be regarded as unsound."
PRECEDENT,The language employed in the ' Tamliknama ' (exhibit II) is almost similar to the language of the deeds construed in Bhaidas Shivdas vs Bai Gulab & Another( '2) and Bishunath Prasad Singh vs Chandika Prasad Kumari and Others(s) where it was held that an absolute estate was conveyed.
RPC,I agree that the judgment and decree of the High Court should be set aside and that the decree of the trial Judge should be restored with costs to the appellant in all the Courts.
RPC,Appeal allowed.

FACTS,It may be mentioned here that prior to that date there was no law in the Nabha State imposing income tax on the subjects of that State.
FACTS,"On November 14, 1948, the Commissioner of Income tax issued a Notification (No. 4, dated 132 29 7 2005) intimating that persons belonging to the Cove nanting States of Nabha and Nalagarh would be assessed to income tax under the Patiala Income Tax Act, 2001."

STATUTE,""" By section 2 (a) the ""appointed day"" was defined as meaning the 5th day of Bhadon, 2005, corresponding to August 20, 1948."
STATUTE,There was a section providing for adaptation similar to section 6 of the Ordinance 1 of 2005.
FACTS,"There was another Ordinance to which reference has to be made, namely, Ordinance No. 1 of 2006 called the Finance Ordinance promul gated on April 13, 1949, which came into force on that very date."
STATUTE,"Section 5 of that Ordinance introduced several amend ments to the Patiala Income Tax Act, 2001."
STATUTE,"It recast 133 sections 3 and 34 of that Act and introduced a new section as section 23B. Section 6 of that Ordinance runs thus: ""6."
FACTS,"For the assessment year beginning on the 1st day of Baisakh, 2006, that is to say, in respect of the accounting the income, profits and gains of the previous year ending on the last day of Chet, 2005, (a) income tax shall be charged at the rates specified in Part I of the Second Schedule to this Ordinance, and (b) rates of super tax shall, for the purposes of sec tion 55 of the Patiala Income Tax Act, 2001, be specified in Part II of the Second Schedule to this Ordinance."
FACTS,""" It is in this setting that the facts leading to the present petition have to be considered."
FACTS,The petitioner is a resident of Ateli in the district of Mohindargarh now in Pepsu but which formerly formed part of the Nabha State.
FACTS,The petitioner has been carrying on his business at Ateli for a number of years under the ' name and style of Raghunath Rai Ram Parshad.
FACTS,He never paid any income tax as no such tax was imposed by any law in the Nabha State.
FACTS,"On October '20, 1949, the petitioner was served with a notice under sections 22(2) and 88 of the Patiala Income Tax Act, 2001, requiring him to submit a return for the Income Tax year 2006 (13 4 1949 to 12 4 1950) disclosing his income during the previous year (13 4 1948 to 12 4 1949)."
FACTS,"The petitioner, on December 4, 1949, filed his return for the year 2006 and on February 14, 1950, he was assessed to income tax."
FACTS,"On May 23, 1950, the petitioner received a notice under section 34 calling upon him to file his return for the year ending the last day of Chet 2005, i.e., for the year 13 4 1948 to 12 4 1949."
FACTS,"In this return he had to specify his income of the previous year, namely, 2004 (i.e., 13 4 1947 to 12 4 1948)."
FACTS,"It ap pears that the petitioner along with other assessees of Ateli and Kanina submitted a petition before the Income Tax Officer on July 9, 1950, asking him not to 134 proceed with the assessment for the year 2005 but on July 13, 1950, the Income Tax Officer assessed him to the best of his judgment under section 34(4) read with section 22(4) of the Income Tax Act."
FACTS,"The petitioner along with other asses sees similarly situated moved the Income Tax Commissioner and the Central Board of Revenue, New Delhi, but without any success."
FACTS,No formal appeal under the Patiala Income Tax Act appears to have been filed by the petitioner against assess ments for either of the two years 2005 and 2006.
FACTS,"On August 10, 1950, the petitioner filed his present petition before this Court under article 32 of the Constitution praying that a writ in the nature of a writ of certiorari be issued for quashing the assessments of the petitioner 's income accrued in the years 2004 and 2005 and other ancillary reliefs."
FACTS,During the pendency of this petition the income tax authori ties have issued a notice under section 46 intimating that penalty will be imposed if the tax was not paid up.
FACTS,The contention of the petitioner in the first place is that he has been denied the fundamental right of equality before the law and the equal protection of the laws guaran teed to him by article 14 of the Constitution.
FACTS,His griev ances are formulated in paragraphs 10 and 11 of his peti tion.
FACTS,"It is said that while the people of Kapurthala which is included in Pepsu have been asked to pay income tax for the period prior to August 20, 1948, at the old rate fixed by the Kapurthala Income Tax Act which was lower than the rate fixed by the Patiala Income Tax Act, 2001, the people of Nabha who had not to pay any income tax prior to August 20, 1948, at all have been made liable to pay at the higher Patiala rate and that such discrimination offends against the provisions of article 14."
FACTS,"This charge is refuted by paragraph 10 of the affidavit of Sardar Gurbax Singh, the Additional Director of Inspection (income Tax), New Delhi, who was formerly the Commissioner of Income Tax, Punjab and Pepsu, which has been filed in opposition to the present petition."
FACTS,"It is there stated that for the assessment year 2005, in Kapurthala the assessees whose cases were pending on 135 August 20, 1948, were assessed under the Kapurthala Income Tax Act at rates fixed thereunder but that for the assess ment year 2006 the provisions of the Patiala Income Tax Act and the rates prescribed thereunder were uniformly applied in all areas of the Pepsu, including Kapurthala This alle gation which is not denied in the affidavit filed by the petitioner in reply must be taken as correct."
REASONING,"The assess ment of Kapurthala assessees for the year 2005 at the old Kapurthala rate was obviously made under the proviso to section 3 of Ordinance No. 1 of 2005, which was reproduced in the proviso to section 3(1)of the Ordinance No. XVI of 2006 and both of which required all pending proceedings to be completed according to the law applicable to those pro ceedings when they were initiated."
REASONING,"No case of assessment was pending as against any Nabha assessee on August 20, 1948, for there was no Income Tax Act in Nabha prior to that date and, therefore, there could be no occasion for completing any pending proceedings against any of such assessees."
REASONING,"In the premises, there can be no grievance by them on the score of discrimination."
REASONING,"The discrimination, if any, was not brought about by the two Ordinances, but by the circumstance that there was no Income Tax Act in Nabha and consequently there was no case of assessment pending against any Nabha assessees."
REASONING,In any case the provision that pending proceed ings should be concluded according to the law applicable at the time when the rights or liabilities accrued and the proceedings commenced is a reasonable law rounded upon a reasonable classification of the assessees which is permis sible under the equal protection clause and to which no exception can be taken.
REASONING,In our opinion the grievance of the alleged infringement of fundamental right under Article 14 is not well founded at all.
REASONING,"Dr. Tek Chand appearing in support of the petition next contends that the administration of Nabha State having been taken over by the Raj Pramukh only on August 20, 1948, and the Patiala law including the Patiala Income Tax Act, 2001, having been brought 136 into operation on and from August 20, 1948, the assessment of the tax on the petitioner 's income which accrued prior to August 20, 1948, was wholly illegal and not authorised by the said Ordinances and the State by insisting on collecting the tax so illegally assessed was threatening to invade the petitioner 's fundamental right to property guaranteed by article 31(1) of the Constitution."
STATUTE,"Article 31(1) runs as follows: ""(1) No person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law."
STATUTE,""" It will be noticed that clause (1) reproduces subsection (1) of section 299 of the Government of India Act, 1935, without the words ""in British India."
STATUTE,""" Reference has 'next to be made to article 265 which is in Part XII, Chapter I, dealing with ""Finance."" That article provides that no tax shall be levied or collected except by authority of law."
STATUTE,"There 'was no similar provision in the corresponding chapter of the Government of India Act, 1935."
STATUTE,"If collection of taxes amounts to deprivation of property within the meaning of article 31(1), then there was no point in making a sepa rate provision again as has been made in article 265."
STATUTE,"It, therefore, follows that clause (1) of article 31 must be regarded as concerned with deprivation of property otherwise than by the imposition or collection of tax, for otherwise article 265 becomes wholly redundant."
REASONING,In the United States of America the power of taxation is regarded as distinct from the exercise of police power or eminent domain.
REASONING,Our Constitution evidently has also treated taxation as distinct from compulsory acquisition of property and has made inde pendent provision giving protection against taxation save by authority of law.
REASONING,"When Dr. Tek Chand was asked if that was not the correct position, he did ,not advance any cogent or convincing answer to refute the conclusion put to him."
REASONING,"In our opinion, the protection against imposition and collec tion of taxes save by authority of law directly comes from article 265, and is not secured by clause (1) of article 31."
STATUTE,"Article 265, 137 not being in Chapter IIi of the Constitution, its protection is not a fundamental right which can be enforced by an application to this court under article 32."
STATUTE,It is not our purpose to say that the right secured by article 265 may not be enforced.
REASONING,It may certainly be enforced by adopting proper proceedings.
REASONING,All that we wish to state is that this application in so far as it purports to be rounded on arti cle 32 read with article 31(1) to this Court is misconceived and must fail.
REASONING,"The whole of Dr. Tek Chand 's argument was rounded on the basis that protection against imposition and collection of taxes save by authority of law was guaranteed by article 31(1) and his endeavour was to establish that the Pepsu Ordinances could not, in law, and did not, on a correct interpretation of them, impose any income tax retrospective ly; that the Income Tax Officer on an erroneous view of the law had wrongly assessed the tax on income accrued prior to August 20, 1948, and that consequently the petitioner was being threatened with deprivation of property otherwise than by authority of law."
RPC,"In the view we have taken, namely, that the protection against imposition or collection of taxes save by authority of law is secured by article 265 and not by article 31(1), the questions urged by Dr. Tek Chand do not really arise and it is not necessary to express any opinion on them on this application."
RPC,Those questions can only arise in appropriate proceedings and not on an applica tion under article 32.
RPC,In our judgment this application fails on the simple ground that no fundamental right of the petitioner has been infringed either under article 14 or under article 31(1) and we accordingly dismiss the petition with costs.
RPC,Petition dismissed.

FACTS,"KANIA C.J. This is an appeal under article 132 of the Constitution of India from the judgment of the 214 High Court at Calcutta, which rejected the habeas corpus petitions of the appellants."
FACTS,"The detention orders under the , in all cases were served on the appellants on the 26th February, 1950, and the grounds for the detention were served on the 14th March, 1950."
FACTS,"By way of specimen we quote one of them: ""You are beings detained in pursuance of a detention order made under sub clause (ii) of clause (a) of subsection (1)of section a of the , (Act IV of 1950), on the following grounds: (1) That you have been assisting the operations of the Communist Party of India, which along with its volunteer organisations has been declared unlawful by Government under section 16 of the Indian Criminal Law Amendment Act (Act XIV of 1908), and which has for its object commission of rioting with deadly weapons, robbery, dacoity, arson and murder and possession and use of arms and ammunitions and explosives and thus acting in a manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order and that it is necessary to prevent you from acting in such manner."
FACTS,"(2) That as a member of the C.P.I. on its Kishan front, you have fomented trouble amongst the peasants of Howrah District and incited them to acts of lawlessness and vio lence: and have thereby acted in a manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order: That as a worker of the C.P.I. you have tried to foment trouble amongst the tramways men and other workers at Cal cutta and in speeches which you delivered at the University Hall and other places you actually incited them to resort to acts of violence and lawlessness; and have thereby acted in a manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order."
FACTS,""" On the 16th of July, 1950, the Government of West Bengal served on the appellants ""in continuation of the grounds already furnished on the 14th of March, 1950, supplementary grounds"" for their detention a specimen of which is in the following terms: 215 ""In continuation of the grounds already furnished under order No. 6163 H.S. dated 14th March, 1950, you are being informed of the supplementary grounds for your detention which are as follows: You as the Secretary of the Bengal Chatkar Mazdoor Union, as a member of the Executive Committee of the Federa tion of Mercantile Employees ' Union, as the honorary report er of the 'Khabar ' newspaper (C. P.I. organ) carried on the disruptive programme of the C.P.I."
FACTS,"On the 29th July, 1948, you along with others led a procession at Howrah preaching discontent against Government and have been thus acting in a manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order. ' ' As in the case of the first grounds, these ""supplemen tary grounds"" were also served on each appellant separately."
FACTS,"The appellants applied for a Rule of habeas corpus separate ly under section 491 of the Criminal Procedure Code and on the 21st July, 1950, the High Court issued a Rule in each case on the Chief Secretary to the Government of West Ben gal."
FACTS,"A second set of grounds were communicated to the appellants on the 22nd or 23rd of July, 1950."
FACTS,"A specimen of one is in the following terms: ""In continuation of the grounds already furnished under order No. 12820 dated 14th July, 1950, you are being in formed of the supplementary grounds for your detention which are as follows: 1."
FACTS,"That in a meeting held at the University Institute on the 19th March, 1947, under the auspices of the Calcutta Tramway Workers ' Union, you held out the threat that any attempt to take out tram cars on the 20th March, 1947, would be inviting disaster and you further said that if the au thorities tried to resume the tram service you and your friends would not hesitate to remove the tram lines and cut the wires."
FACTS,"That on the 13th June, 1948, you presided over a meeting under the auspices of the Students ' Federation (C. P.I. controlled) and delivered speech 28 216 advocating withdrawal of ban on the Communist Party of India and its organ Swadhinta."" The High Court after considering the whole matter re jected the petitions of the appellants and the appellants have thereupon come in appeal before us."
RLC,"In the High Court, it was first contended on behalf of the appellants that the communication of the grounds dated the 14th March was not a compliance with article 22 (5)of the Constitution of India, as those grounds were not commu nicated ""as soon as may be."
RLC,""" The High Court rejected this contention."
REASONING,"Under the circumstances of the case, we agree with the High Court and are unable to hold that in furnish ing the grounds dated the 14th March, 1950, the authorities had failed to act in accordance with the procedure laid down in article 22 (5) of the Constitution."
REASONING,"Under the Bengal Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1930, a very large number of persons were detained."
RLC,"The validity of that Act was being challenged in the High Court and the judgment was expected to be delivered towards the end of February, 1950."
REASONING,"The , was passed by the Parliament of India in the last week of February, 1950, and these orders on all those detenus were served on the 26th of February, 1950."
REASONING,"Having regard to the fact that the Provin cial Government had thus suddenly to deal with a large number of cases on one day, we are unable to accept this contention of the appellants."
REASONING,"On behalf of the appellants it was next urged that there has been a non compliance with the procedure laid down in article 22 (s)of the Constitution and section 7 of the in the manner of supplying grounds to the appellants resulting in not providing to the appel lants the earliest opportunity to make a representation, which they had a right to make."
REASONING,In the judgment delivered today in Case No. 22 of 1950(1) we have discussed in detail the nature of the two rights conferred under article 22 (5).
REASONING,We have to apply those principles to the facts of this appeal for its decision.
REASONING,"(11 Supra, P. 167. 217 When the authorities sent their second communication dated 16th July, 1950, to the appellants they described it as ""in continuation of the grounds already furnished"" and as the ""supplementary grounds for your detention""."
REASONING,Relying on the wording of this communication it was argued that these were additional grounds which were furnished to the detenu and therefore the procedure prescribed under article 22 (5) had not been followed.
REASONING,"It was argued that the obligation to communicate grounds ""as soon as may be"" was absolute."
REASONING,The grounds for detention must be before the Provincial Government before they could be satisfied about the necessity for making the detention order.
REASONING,"If the grounds before the detaining authorities on the 26th of February, 1950, were only those which they communicated on the 14th of March, they cannot support the detention on additional grounds which were not before them on that day and which they set out in the second communication four months later."
REASONING,It was also contended that the fact of this communication showed that the authorities were not satisfied on the origi nal grounds and had therefore put forth these supplementary grounds as an afterthought.
REASONING,In our opinion these arguments cannot be accepted.
REASONING,"A 'description of the contents of the second communication as ""supplementary grounds"" does not necessarily make them additional or new grounds."
REASONING,One has to look at the contents to find out whether they are new grounds as explained in our judgment in Case No. 92 of 1950(1).
REASONING,"Examining the contents of the later communication in that way we find that they only furnish details of the second heads of the grounds furnished to the appropriate appellant on 14th March, 1950, in respect of his activities."
RLC,We are unable to treat them as new grounds and we agree with the High Court in its conclusion that these are not fresh or new grounds.
REASONING,We do not think it proper to consider the true effect of the communication only by reading its opening words.
REASONING,The whole of it must be read and considered togeth er.
REASONING,"The contention that the authorities were not satisfied on the original (1) Supra, p. 167."
REASONING,218 grounds and therefore put forth this.
REASONING,communication as the supplemental grounds is again unsound.
REASONING,The fact that these details were communicated later does not necessarily show that they were not within the knowledge of the authorities when they sent the communication dated the 14th of March.
REASONING,"The contention that this communication of the 16th of July, 1950, was not ""as soon as may be"", has to be rejected having regard to the principles set out in our judgment in Case No. 22 of 1950."
REASONING,"The facts in each case have to to be taken into consideration and if the detained person contends that this part of the procedure prescribed in article 22 (5) was not complied with, the authorities will have to place materials before the court to refute that contention."
RLC,In the present case the High Court has considered that there has been no infringement of this procedural law and we see no reason to come to a different conclusion.
ARG,"It was next argued that the grounds being vague, they could not be considered as grounds at all and therefore they could not be sufficient ""to satisfy"" the authorities."
REASONING,On this point we have nothing to add to what we have stated in our judgment in Case No. 22 of 1950.
REASONING,"We are unable to accept the contention that ""vague grounds"" stand on the same footing as ""irrelevant grounds""."
REASONING,An irrelevant ground has no connection at all with the satisfaction of the Provincial Government which makes the order of detention.
REASONING,For the reasons stated in that judgment we are also unable to accept the contention that if the grounds are vague and no repre sentation is possible there can be no satisfaction of the authority as required under section 3 of the .
REASONING,This argument mixes up two objects.
REASONING,"The sufficiency of the grounds, which gives rise to the satis faction of the Provincial Government, is not a matter for examination by the court."
REASONING,"The sufficiency of the grounds to give the detained person the earliest opportunity to make a representation can be examined by the court, but only from that point of view."
REASONING,We are therefore unable to accept the contention that the quality and characteristic of 219 the grounds should be the same for both tests.
REASONING,"On the ques tion of satisfaction, as has been often stated, one person may be, but another may not be, satisfied on the same grounds."
REASONING,"That aspect however is not for the determination of the court, having regard to the words used in the Act."
REASONING,The second part of the enquiry is clearly open to the court under article 22 (5).
REASONING,We are therefore unable to accept the argument that if the grounds are not sufficient or adequate for making the representation the grounds cannot be suffi cient for the subjective satisfaction of the authority.
REASONING,"As regards the grounds furnished by the Government in each case in its first communication, it is sufficient to notice that while the first ground is common to all the appellants, the second ground is different in most cases."
RLC,"The High Court has considered the case of each appellant in respect of the communication dated the 14th of March, 1950, sent to him."
REASONING,In their opinion those grounds are not vague.
REASONING,They have held that the procedural requirement to give the detained person the earliest opportunity to make a represen tation has not been infringed by the communication of the grounds of the 14th of March and by the subsequent communi cation made to the appellants in July.
REASONING,This point was not seriously pressed before us.
REASONING,After hearing counsel for the appellant we see no reason to differ from the conclusion of the High Court on this point.
REASONING,The result is that the appeal fails and is dismissed.
PRECEDENT,"This appeal was heard along with Case No. 22 of 1950 (The State of Bombay vs Atma Ram Sridhar Vaidya)(1), as the main question involved was the same."
REASONING,"In the view I have expressed on that question in my judgment delivered today in that case, this appeal cannot succeed and I agree that it should be dismissed."
REASONING,"The same important questions have been raised in this appeal by 100 detenus against an order of a Bench of the Calcutta High Court as were raised (1) Supra, p. 167, 220 by the detenu in the appeal of the State of Bombay in which judgment has just been delivered."
REASONING,"One additional point raised in this appeal was that the fact that a large number of fresh orders of detention were made ""overnight"" indicates bad faith on the part of the authorities, for the authori ties could not have applied their minds to each individual case."
REASONING,I am unable to accept this contention as correct.
REASONING,The authorities had already applied their minds to the suspected activities of each of the detenus and were satisfied that with a view to prevent them from doing some prejudicial act of a particular kind it was necessary to make an order of detention against them under the local Acts.
REASONING,There being doubt as to the validity of the local Acts and the Preven tive Detention Act having been passed in the meantime the question was to make a fresh order under the new Act.
REASONING,"The minds of the authorities having already been made up as to the expediency of making an order of detention against them, an elaborate application of mind, such as is now suggested, does not appear to me to be necessary at all."
REASONING,I do not think there was any failure of duty on the part of the authorities which will establish bad faith on their part.
REASONING,"In my view, for reasons stated in my judgment in the other appeal, there being no proof of any mala fides on the part of the authori ties, no fundamental rights of the petitioners have been infringed."
REASONING,"In the case of each of the detenus, apart from the common ground, there were one or more specific grounds of detention which are quite sufficient to enable the detenu concerned to make his representation."
REASONING,"Therefore, the question of supplementary particulars does not arise at all."
RPC,"In my opinion the conclusions arrived at by Roxburgh J. were correct and well founded, and, therefore, this appeal should be dismissed."
RPC,Appeal dismissed.

FACTS,"The decision of these four ap peals, which are connected with each other and which have arisen out of orders made by the High Court of Patna in four Miscellaneous Appeals, depends on the interpretation of section 7 of the Bihar Moneylenders (Regulation of Transac tions) Act, 1939."
FACTS,"The facts which have led to the appeals are found brief ly stated in the petition filed by the present appellants in the 3rd Court of Sub Judge, Patna, and may be re stated here for convenient reference : ""The father of the petitioners borrowed Rs. 40,000 from the guru (ancestor) of the decree holder under mortgage bond, dated 11 1 1893."

FACTS,"Mort , gage Suit No. 110 of 1927 was brought in the 3rd Court of the Sub Judge, Patna, and a decree for Rs. 58,012 2.0 was passed on 9 7 1929."
FACTS,"Out of this Rs. 5,000 was paid in cash and for the balance of Rs. 53,012 12 0 one mortgage bond dated 6 10 1931 was executed for Rs. 42,000 and on the same date two 140 hand notes were executed, viz., one for Rs. 5,000 and one for Rs. 6012 2 0."
FACTS,"One Suit No. 14 of 1933 for both the hand notes was brought in 3rd Court of the Sub Judge and a decree for Rs. 15,008 2 0 was passed on 28 2 1935."
FACTS,This decree is under execution.
FACTS,""" When the decree holder sought to execute the money decree by attachment and sale of the judgmentdebtors ' properties stating that they were subject to a mortgage lien of Rs. 62,272 13 0 under the mortgage bond dated 6 10 1931, the two judgment debtors, who are brothers, filed objec tions under sections 11 and 16 of the earlier Bihar Money lenders Act III of 1938 and section 47 of the Civil Procedure Code."
FACTS,The petitions (two by each of them) were filed separately by the brothers.
FACTS,"They urged that on a proper calculation under section 11 no lien was subsisting on the properties owing to payments made towards the mort gage debt amounting to Rs. 92,394 2 0."
RLC,The Subordinate Judge held that this plea of the judgment debtors could not be entertained in the Miscellaneous case before him relating to the execution and all that could be done was to notify the mortgage encumbrance without deciding anything as to the correctness of the amount claimed to be due under it; and this conclusion was partly based on the fact that section 16 of the Act had been declared by the High Court void.
RLC,Ap peals taken to the High Court were dismissed.
STATUTE,"The judgment debtors thereupon preferred an appeal to the Feder al Court, contending that sections 7 and 13 of the new Act (corresponding to sections 7 and 11 of the old Act)were applicable and that it was the duty of the court to estimate the value of the property after making the necessary calcu lations under section 7 with reference to the lien."
PRECEDENT,The decision of the Federal Court is reported in Ramnandan Prasad Narain Singh and Another vs Kulpati Shri Mahanth Goshwarni Madhwanand Ramji(1).
FACTS,"The case was remitted back to the High (1) 141 Court, giving liberty to the appellants to file an applica tion under section 13."
FACTS,"In answer to a fresh application for execution dated 2 7 1042, the two brothers filed the same objections as before."
FACTS,Miscellaneous Cases Nos. 45 and 46 of 1942 related to sections 7 and 13 of the Bihar Money lenders Act and Miscellaneous Cases Nos. 50 and 52 of 1042 related to the objections under section 47 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
RLC,"The Subordinate Judge held that the amount of the loan should be taken as the amount mentioned in the mortgage deed of 1931 and not the amount advanced in 1893 and that a sum of Rs. 70,840 was still due on the bond."
RLC,"He determined the market value of the several properties given as security, adopting 16 times the net income as the basis."
RLC,Appeals to the High Court were numbered as M.A. 108 to 111 of 1943 and they were heard by Manohar Lall and Imam JJ.
RLC,They modified the order of the lower Court in certain re spects.
REASONING,"Even according to them the amount of the loan was what was mentioned in the mortgage bond of 6 10 1931, but as a sum of Rs. 11,855 3 0 had been repaid expressly towards the principal amount after the date of the bond, that amount became reduced to Rs. 28,150."
REASONING,"Adding an equal sum by way of interest which according to them was the maximum amount, permitted to be allowed under section 7 of the Act, the total liability was stated to be Rs. 56,300 and a charge was declared on the property for this amount."
REASONING,They also directed that the valuation of the property should be fixed at twenty times the net income and not sixteen times.
REASONING,It is from this order that the present appeals have been preferred.
REASONING,"Two points were urged on behalf of the appellants, namely (a) that the decree holder was barred by construc tive res judicata from contending that the construction placed upon section 7 by the judgmentdebtors was wrong; and (b) that in applying section 7, we must consider the origi nal amount of loan of Rs. 40,000 given in the year 1893 and allow the claim 142 of interest only for that maximum sum, after taking into account all sums paid by the appellants and their predeces sors towards interest since 1893."
REASONING,The first point is entirely without substance.
REASONING,"When the decree holder contended that section 11 of the Bihar Money lenders Act, 1938, was declared void and ultra vires and that therefore section 7 of the new Act which corresponded to section 11 was also inapplicable, the judgment debtors pleaded that they were entitled to the benefit of section 7 of the new Act."
PRECEDENT,The Federal Court held in Ramnandan Prasad Narain Singh and Another vs Kulpati Shri Mahanth Goshwami Madhwanand Ramji(1) that the judgment debtors (present appellants) were entitled to claim the benefit of the provi sions of the new Act when the executing court proceeded under section 13 to determine the value of the properties to be sold.
STATUTE,The correct interpretation of section 7 was not in question between the parties.
STATUTE,To say that the appellants were entitled to take advantage of the provisions of section 7 is entirely different from the contention that the inter pretation sought to be put by them on section 7 was the right one.
REASONING,"It is impossible to see where the doctrine of constructive res judicata comes in, so as to be of help to the appellants."
REASONING,"The second question raised on their behalf relates to the true meaning of section 7 of the Bihar Moneylenders (Regulation of Transactions) Act VII of 1939, which is in these terms: ""7."
REASONING,"Notwithstanding anything to the contrary con tained in any other law or in anything having the force of law or in any agreement, no Court shall, in any suit brought by a money lender before or after the commencement of this Act in respect of a loan advanced before or after the com mencement of this Act or in any appeal or proceedings in revision arising out of such suit, pass a decree for an amount of interest for the period preceding the institution of the suit, (1) 143 which together with any amount already realised as interest through the court or otherwise, is greater than the amount of loan advanced, or, if the loan is based on a document, the amount of loan mentioned in, or evidenced by, such document."
REASONING,""" In the present case, the original loan of Rs. 40,000 was advanced as early as 11 1 1893."
REASONING,"The appellants j contend that for the purposes of calculating the interest to be decreed prior to the date of the suit the loan advanced must be taken to be the original sum and that if an account is taken of all the sums received by the creditor as interest from that date up to the date of the suit, there would be nothing due for interest."
REASONING,"On the other hand, the decree holder urges that having regard to the latter part of the section, the loan must be taken to be the amount mentioned in the mortgage bond dated 8 10 1931, namely Rs. 42,000."
REASONING,"Whichever method of calculation is adopted, it must be remembered that it has to be made not for the purposes of passing any decree on the mortgage loan, but for estimating under section 13 of the Act the value of the properties to be brought to sale in execution of the money decree against the appellants."
PRECEDENT,"As pointed out by Sir Maurice Gwyer C.J. in Surendra Prasad Narain Singh vs Sri Gajadhar Prasad Sahu Trust Estate and Otherse), ""Section 7 of the Act of 1937 is no doubt extremely obscure and illdrawn."
REASONING,""" The true intention of the framers of the Act is somewhat difficult to gather."
RLC,But the Patna High Court has been consistently placing upon the section an interpretation which is opposed to the contention of the appellant in these proceedings.
PRECEDENT,"The point came up expressly for decision in Singhesh war Singh and Others vs Madni Prasad Singh Others(2) where a mortgage bond was executed on 31 8 1922 for a sum of Rs. 2,000 which was the balance of the principal and inter est due under a mortgage bond of the 11th of October, 1912, for (1) (2)A.T.R. 1940 Pat."
REASONING,"The judgment debtors raised the plea that the court should go back to the earlier bond of 1912 and that as a sum of Rs. 1,512 had been paid as and by way of interest towards that bond, no decree could be passed against them for more than the principal sum of Rs. 1,391."
REASONING,"The learned Judges rejected this contention and took the amount stated in the document of 1922, namely Rs. 2,000, as the loan and they held that the plaintiffs were entitled to get a decree for interest for a sum not larger than Rs. 2,000 as no payment had been proved to have been made after the execution of the bond."
REASONING,"The same view was taken in Lal Singh vs Ramnarain Ram and Others(1) and the plain tiffs were awarded a decree on the basis that the loan was to be taken as Rs. 2,909 8 0 which was the amount for which the hand note sued upon was executed and not Rs. 1,000 which was the original amount advanced upon an earlier hand note of the year 1924."
REASONING,The case reported in Madho Prasad Singh vs Mukutdhari Singh and Others(2) lays down the same position.
REASONING,"The Full Bench decision in Deo Nandan Prasad vs Ram Prasad (3) rei terates the same view, pointing out the distinction between sections 7 and 8 of the Act and stating that while under section 8 we can go to the original loan in spite of a later document, under section 7, the loan must relate to the document on which the suit is based, that is, the final document and not the original one."
REASONING,"In each one of these cases, the question of the true meaning of section 7 was pointedly considered."
REASONING,This construction no doubt enables a creditor to circumvent the beneficent provisions of the Act by taking a document for the interest due and adding it to the principal amount.
PRECEDENT,Gwyer C.J. points out this difficulty at page 59 in the case Surendra Prasad Narain Singh vs Sri Gajadhar Prasad Sahu Trust Estate and Others(4).
REASONING,"If the interpretation does not carry out the intentions of the framers of the Act by reason of unhappy or ambiguous phrasing, it is for the Legis lature to intervene."
REASONING,"145 acquiesced, during all these years in the construction which the Patna High Court has been placing upon the section from the very next year after the enactment of the statute."
REASONING,"Having regard to the great obscurity in the language em ployed in the relevant provisions and the inaction of the Legislature, it is, in our opinion, legitimate to infer that the view expressed by the Patna High Court is in accord with the intention of the Legislature."
RLC,Appeals dismissed.
REASONING,"773 The position, therefore, is that to convey an absolute estate to a Hindu female, no express power of alienation need be given; it is enough if words are used of such ampli tude as would convey full rights of ownership."
REASONING,Mr. Banerjee naturally lays stress upon the description of the document as 'Tamliknama ' and the use of the word ' Malik ' or owner in reference to the interest which it pur ports to convey to the transferee.
REASONING,The word ' Malik ' is of very common use in many parts of India and it cannot cer tainly be regarded as a technical term of conveyancing.
REASONING,"In the language of the Privy Council, the term 'Malik ' when used in a will or other document ""as descriptive of the position which a devisee or donee is intended to hold, has been held apt to describe an owner possessed of full pro prietory rights, including a full right of alienation, unless there is something in the context or in the surround ing circumstances to indicate that such full proprietory rights were not intended to be conferred(1). ' ' This I think to be a perfectly correct statement of law and I only desire to add that it should be taken with the caution which the Judicial Committee uttered in course of the same observa tion that ""the meaning of every word in an Indian document must always depend upon the setting in which it is placed, the subject to which it is related and the locality of the grantor from which it receives its true shade of meaning."
RLC,The High Court in reaching its decision adverse to the appellant laid great stress on the fact that the grant was expressed to be for maintenance and residence of Mst.
REASONING,"This, it is said, would prima facie indicate that the grant was to enure for the lifetime of the grantee."
PRECEDENT,"It is pointed out by the learned (1) Vide Sasiman Chowdhurain vs Shib Narayan, 49 I.A, 25."
REASONING,99 774 Judges that the language of the document does not show that anybody else besides the lady herself was to be benefited by the grant and the indemnity given by Babu Ram was also given to the lady personally.
REASONING,"It is further said that if Meria was given an absolute estate in the properties comprised in the 'Tamliknama ', there was no necessity for including these two properties again in the deed of relinquishment which she executed at the same time."
REASONING,"I do not think that the mere fact that the gift of property is made for the support and maintenance of a female relation could be taken to be a prima facie indication of the intention of the donor, that the donee was to enjoy the property only during her life time."
REASONING,"The extent of interest, which the donee is to take, depends upon the intention of the donor as expressed by the language use, d, and if the dispositive words employed in the document are clear and unambiguous and import absolute ownership, the purpose of the grant would not, by itself, restrict or cut down the interest."
REASONING,"The desire to provide maintenance or residence of the donee would only show the motive which prompted the donor to make the gift, but it could not be read as a meas ure of the extent of the gift."
PRECEDENT,This was laid down in clear terms by the Judicial Committee in a comparatively recent case which is to be found reported in Bishunath Prasad vs Chandrika(1).
REASONING,"There a Hindu executed a registered deed of gift of certain properties in favour of his daughter in law for the"" support and maintenance"" of his daughter in law and declared that the donee should remain absolute owner of the property (malik mustaqil) and pay Government revenue."
REASONING,There were no words in the document expressly making the interest heritable or conferring on the donee the power of making alienation.
REASONING,"It was held by the Judicial Committee that the donee took under the document, an absolute estate with powers to make alienation giving title valid after her death."
REASONING,"In course of the judgment, Lord Blanesburgh quoted, with approval, an earlier decision of the (1) 60 I.A 56 775 Judicial Committee, where the words ""for your maintenance"" occurring in a deed of gift were held insufficient to cut down to life interest the estate taken by the donees."
REASONING,"These words, it was said, ""are quite capable of signifying that the gift was made for the purpose of enabling them to live in comfort and do not necessarily mean that it was to be limited to a bare right of maintenance."
PRECEDENT,""" On behalf of the respondent, reliance was placed upon the decision of the Judicial Committee in Raja Ram Buksh vs Arjun(1)in support of the contention that in a maintenance grant it is the prima facie intention of the gift that it should be for life."
REASONING,"In my opinion, the decision cited is no authority for the general proposition as is contended for by the learned Counsel for the respondent, and it is to be read in the context of the actual facts of the case which relate to grants of a particular type with special features of its own."
REASONING,It was a case where a Talukdar made a grant of certain villages to a junior member of the joint family for mainte nance of the latter.
REASONING,The family was governed by the law of primegeniture and the estate descended to a single heir.
REASONING,"In such cases the usual custom is that the junior members of the family, who can get no share in the property, are enti tled to provisions by way of maintenance for which assign ments of lands are generally made in their favour."
REASONING,"The extent of interest taken by the grantee in the assigned lands depends entirely upon the circumstances of the partic ular case, or rather upon the usage that prevails in the particular family."
REASONING,In the case before the Privy Council there was actually no deed of transfer.
REASONING,"It was an oral assignment made by the Talukdar, and the nature of the grant had to be determined upon the recitals of a petition for mutation of names made to the Revenue Department by the grantor after the verbal assignment was made and from other facts and circumstances of the case."
PRECEDENT,"The case of Woodoya ditta Deb vs Mukoond(2), which was referred to and relied upon in the judgment of the Privy Council, was (1) 28 I.A, 1."
REASONING,"776 also a case of maintenance or khor phos grant made in favour of a junior member of the family, where theestate was im partible and descended under the rules of primogeniture."
REASONING,"It was held in that case that such grants, the object of which was to make suitable provisions for the immediate members of the family, were by their very nature and also under the custom of the land resumable by the zemindar on the death of the grantee, as otherwise the whole zemindary would be swallowed up by continual demands."
REASONING,"This principle bas obviously no application to cases of the type which we have before us and it was never so applied by the Privy Council, as would appear from the decision referred to above."
REASONING,"The learned Counsel for the plaintiff respondent drew our attention in this connection, to the fact that the properties given by the ,Tamliknama ' were valued at Rs. 8,000, whereas the entire estate left by Mangal Sen was worth Rs. 25,000 only."
REASONING,"It is argued that the transfer of nearly one third of the entire estate in absolute right to one who was entitled to maintenance merely, is, on the face of it, against probability and common sense."
REASONING,"I do not think that, on the facts of this case, any weight could be at tached to this argument."
REASONING,"In the first place, it is to be noted that whatever might have been the actual market value of the properties, what the widow got under the Tamliknama was a residential house and a shop, and the shop was the only property which fetched any income."
REASONING,"This shop, it appears, was all along in possession of Sunder Lal, the brother of Meria, and the rent, which he paid or promised to pay in respect of the same, was only Rs. 12 a month."
REASONING,"So from the income of this property it was hardly possible for Meria to have even abate maintenance, and this would rather support the inference that the properties were given to her absolutely and not for enjoyment merely, so long as she lived."
REASONING,"But what is more important is, that the object of creating these two documents, as the surrounding circumstances show, was not merely to make provision 777 for the maintenance of Mst."
REASONING,Meria; the other and the more important object was to perfect the title of Nand Lal to the estate left by Mangal Sen and to quiet all disputes that freight arise in respect of the same.
REASONING,It may be that Mst.
REASONING,"Meria could not, in law, claim any."
REASONING,thing more than a right to be maintained out of the estate of her deceased father in law.
REASONING,"But it is clear that whatever her legal rights might have been, Nand Lal 's own position as the sole owner of the properties left by Mangal Sen was not altogeth er undisputed or free from any hostile attack."
REASONING,"As has been said already, Sunder Lal, the brother of Meria, was in occupation of the double storied shop from long before the Tamliknama was executed and Meria got any legal title to it."
REASONING,It appears from the record that in 1920 a suit was institut ed on behalf of the infant Nand Lal for evicting Sunder Lal from the shop and the allegation in the plaint was that Sunder Lal was occupying the property as a tenant since the time of Mst.
REASONING,Mithani by taking a settlement from her.
REASONING,Sunder Lal in his written statement filed in that suit expressly repudiated the allegation of tenancy and also the title of Nand Lal and openly asserted that it was Mst.
REASONING,Meria who was the actual owner of Mangal Sen 's estate.
REASONING,"The suit ended in a compromise arrived at through the medium of arbitrators and the result was that although Sunder Lal admitted the title of the plaintiff, the latter had to abandon the claims which were made in the plaint for rents, costs and damages."
REASONING,Sunder Lal continued to be in occupation of the shop and executed a rent agreement in respect of the same in favour of Nand Lal promising to pay a rent of Rs. 12 per month.
REASONING,"A few months later, the Tamliknama was executed and this shop along with the residential house were given to Meria in maliki right."
REASONING,"The recitals in both the Tamliknama and the deed of relin quishment clearly indicate that the supreme anxiety on the part of Babu Ram, who was trying his best to safeguard the interests of the minor, was to put an end to all further disputes that might be raised by or on behalf of Mst."
REASONING,Meria with regard to the rights of Nand Lal to the properties 778 of Mangal Sen and to make his title to the same absolutely impeccable.
REASONING,That seems to be the reason why Meria was given a comparatively large portion of the properties left by Mangal Sen which would enable her to live in comfort and her interest was not limited to a bare right of mainte nance.
REASONING,"It is significant to note that the shop room, which was all along in possession of Sunder Lal, was included in this Tamliknama and soon after the grant was made, Sunder Lal executed a rent agreement in respect of the shop in favour of Mst."
REASONING,Meria acknowledging her to be the owner of the property.
REASONING,"It is true that the document does not make any reference to the heirs of Meria, but that is not at all necessary, nor is it essential that any express power of alienation should be given."
REASONING,"The word ""Malik"" is too common an expres sion in this part of the country and its meaning and impli cations were fairly well settled by judicial pronouncements long before the document was executed."
REASONING,"If really the grantee was intended to have only a life interest in the properties, there was no lack of appropriate words, per fectly well known in the locality, to express such inten tion."
REASONING,The High Court seems to have been influenced to some extent by the fact that in the Tamliknama there was a guarantee given by Babu Ram to Meria herself and to no one else agreeing to compensate her in case she was dispossessed from the properties at the instance of Nand Lal.
REASONING,This covenant in the document was in the nature of a personal guarantee given by Babu Ram to Mst.
REASONING,Meria for the simple reason that the property belonged to an infant and it was as guardian of the minor that Babu Ram was purporting to act.
REASONING,It was too much to expect that Babu Ram would bind himself for all time to come and give a guarantee to the future heirs of Meria as well.
REASONING,Probably no such thing was contem plated by the parties and no such undertaking was insisted upon by the other side.
REASONING,"But whatever the reason might be which led to the covenant being expressed in this particu lar form, I do not think that it has even a remote bearing on the 779 question that arises for our consideration in the present case."
REASONING,"It is of no assistance to the plaintiff in support of the construction that is sought to be put upon the , docu ment on his behalf."
REASONING,"I am also not at all impressed by the other fact re ferred to in the judgment of the High Court that if the properties were given to Meria in absolute right, there was no necessity for including them again in the schedule to the deed of relinquishment which Meria executed."
REASONING,I fail to see how the inclusion of the properties in the deed of relin quishment would go to indicate that Meria 's rights to these properties were of a restricted and not an absolute charac ter.
REASONING,It is after all a pure matter of conveyancing and the two documents have to be read together as parts of one and the same ' transaction.
REASONING,"Under the ' Tamliknama ', Meria got two properties in absolute right out of the estate of Mangal Sen."
REASONING,"By the deed of relinquishment, she renounced her claim for maintenance in respect of all the properties left by Mangal Sen including the two items which she got under the 'Tamliknama '."
REASONING,"After the ' Tamliknama ' was executed in her favour, there Was no further question of her claiming any right of maintenance in respect of these two items of property."
REASONING,She became the absolute owner thereof in exchange of her rights of maintenance over the entire estate and this right of maintenance she gave up by the deed of relinquish ment.
REASONING,"On a construction of the entire document, my conclu sion is that there is nothing in the context of the docu ment, or in the surrounding circumstances which would dis place the presumption of full proprietory rights which the use of the word ""Malik"" is apt ordinarily to convey."
REASONING,"The first contention of the appellant, therefore, succeeds and in view of my decision on this point, the second question does not arise for determination at all."
RPC,"The result is that the appeal is allowed, the judgment and decree of the High Court are set aside and those of the trial Judge restored."
RPC,The defendant No. 6 will have his costs from the plaintiff in all the courts.
RPC,There will be no order for costs as regards the other parties: 780 FAZL ALI J.
RPC,"I agree with the judgment delivered by my learned brother, Mukherjea J. CHANDRASEKHARA AIYAR J."
RPC,During the hearing of the appeal I entertained doubts whether the view taken by the High Court was not correct.
RPC,"But on further consideration, I find that it cannot be maintained, having regard to the terms of the ' Tamliknama ' (deed of transfer) in favour of Musammat Meria and the context in which it came into exist ence."
RPC,The name of the document or deed does not very much matter.
RPC,"Though the word ' malik ' is not a term of art, it has been held in quite a large number of cases, decided mostly by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, that the word, as employed in Indian documents, means absolute owner and that unless the context indicated a different meaning, its use would be sufficient to convey a full title even without the addition of the words, ' heirs ', or ' son ', ' grandson ' and ' great grandson '."
RPC,"Of course, if there are other clauses in the document which control the import of the word and restrict the estate to a limited one, we must give the narrower meaning; otherwise the word must receive its full significance."
PRECEDENT,"Especially is this so, when the rule of interpretation laid down in Mohammed Shamsul vs Sewak Ram( ') has come to be regarded as unsound."
PRECEDENT,The language employed in the ' Tamliknama ' (exhibit II) is almost similar to the language of the deeds construed in Bhaidas Shivdas vs Bai Gulab & Another( '2) and Bishunath Prasad Singh vs Chandika Prasad Kumari and Others(s) where it was held that an absolute estate was conveyed.
RPC,I agree that the judgment and decree of the High Court should be set aside and that the decree of the trial Judge should be restored with costs to the appellant in all the Courts.
RPC,Appeal allowed.
NAME,"Brij Bhushan And Another vs The State Of Delhi , 1950 SCR 605"
CITATION,XXIX of 1950.
COUNSEL,"N.C. Chatterjee (B. Banerji, with him) for the petition er."
COUNSEL,May 26.
JUDGE,"was delivered by Patanjali Sastri J. Fazl Ali J. delivered a separate dissenting judgment, 607 PATANJALI SASTRI J. "
FACTS,"On 2nd March, 1950, the respondent, in exercise of powers conferred on him by section 7 (1) (c) of the East Punjab Public Safety Act, 1949, which has been extended to the Delhi Province and is hereinafter referred to as the impugned Act, issued the following order: ""Whereas the Chief Commissioner, Delhi, is satisfied that Organizer, an English weekly of Delhi, has been pub lishing highly objectionable matter constituting a threat to public law and order and that action as is hereinafter mentioned is necessary for the purpose of preventing or combating activities prejudicial to the public safety or the maintenance of public order. "
FACTS,"Now there more in exercise of the powers conferred by section 7 (1)(c) of the East Punjab Public Safety Act, 1949, as extended to the Delhi Province, I, Shankar Prasad, Chief Commissioner, Delhi, do by this order require you Shri Brij Bhushan, Printer and Publisher and Shri K.R. Halkani, Editor of the aforesaid paper to submit for scrutiny, in duplicate, before publication, till further orders, all communal matter and news and views about Pakistan including photographs and cartoons other than those derived from official sources or supplied by the news agencies, viz., Press Trust of India, United Press of India and United Press of America to the Provincial Press Officer, or in his absence, to Superintendent of Press Branch at his office at 5, Alipur Road, Civil Lines, Delhi, between the hours 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. on working days."
ARG,""" The only point argued before us relates to the consti tutional validity of section 7 (1) (c) of the impugned Act which, as appears from its preamble, was passed ""to provide special measures to ensure public safety 608 and maintenance of public order. "
STATUTE,""" Section 7 (1) (c) under which the aforesaid order purports to have been made reads (so far as material here) as follows : ""The Provincial Government or any authority authorised by it in this behalf if satisfied that such action is neces sary for the purpose of preventing or combating any activity prejudicial to the public safety or the maintenance of public order may, by order in writing addressed to a print er, publisher or editor require that any matter relating to a particular subject or class of subjects shall before publication be submitted for scrutiny."""
ARG,The petitioners claim that this provision infringes the fundamental right to the freedom of speech and expression conferred upon them by article 19 (1) (a) of the Constitu tion inasmuch as it authorises the imposition of a restric tion on the publication of the journal which is not justi fied under clause (2) of that article. 
ARG,There can be little doubt that the imposition of precensorship on a journal is a restriction on the liberty of the press which is an essential part of the right to freedom of speech and expression declared by article 19 (1)(a). 
ARG,"As pointed out by Blackstone in his Commentaries ""the liberty of the press consists in laying no previous restraint upon publications, and not in freedom from censure for criminal matter when published. "
ARG,"Every freeman has an undoubted right to lay what sentiments he pleases before the public; to forbid this, is to destroy the freedom of the press(1)."
RPC,"Accordingly, for the reasons indicated in that judgment, we allow this petition and hereby quash the impugned order of the Chief Commissioner, Delhi, dated the 2nd March, 1950. "
PRECEDENT,"(2) Romesh Thappar vs The State of Madras, supra p. 594. "
PRECEDENT,"The question raised in this case relates to the validity of 'section 7 (1) (c) of the East Punjab Public Safety Act, 1949 (as extended to the Province of Delhi), which runs as follows : ""The Provincial Government or any authority authorised by it in this behalf if satisfied that such action is neces sary for the purpose of preventing or combating any activity prejudicial to the public safety or the maintenance of public order, may, by order in writing addressed to a print er, publisher or editor * * * * (c) require that any matter relating to a particular subject or class of subjects shall before publication be submitted for scrutiny;"" It should be noted that the provisions of sub clause (c) arc not in general terms but are confined to a ""particular subject or class of subjects,"" and that having regard to the context in which these words are used, they must be connected with ""public safety or the maintenance of public order."
FACTS,The order in question recites among other things that the Chief Commissioner is satisfied that the Organizer has been publishing highly objectionable matter constituting a threat to public law and order and that action to which reference has been made is necessary for the purpose of preventing or combating activities 610 prejudicial to the public safety or the maintenance of public order. 
ARG,"It is contended on behalf of the petitioners that notwithstanding these recitals the order complained against is liable to be quashed, because it amounts to an infringement of the right of freedom of speech and expression guaranteed by article 19 (1) (a) of the Constitution. "
STATUTE,"Articles 19 (1) (a) and (2), which are to be read together, run as follows : 19, (1) All citizens shall have the right (a) to freedom of speech and expression; * * * * (2) Nothing in sub clause (a) of clause (1) shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it relates to, or prevent the State from making any law relating to, libel, slander, defamation, contempt of Court or any matter which offends against decency or morality or which undermines the security of, or tends to overthrow, the State. "
RPC,""" It is contended that section 7 (1)(c) of the Act, under which the impugned order has been made, cannot be saved by clause (2) of article 19 of the Constitution, because it does not relate to any matter which undermines the security of, or tends to overthrow, the State. "
RPC,Thus the main ground of attack is that the impugned law is an infringement of a fundamental right and is not saved by the so called saving clause to which reference has been made. 
RPC,"There can be no doubt that to impose pre censorship on a journal, such as has been ordered by the Chief Commissioner in this case, is a restriction on the liberty of the press which is included in the right to freedom of speech and expression guaranteed by article 19 (1) (a) of the Constitu tion, and the only question which we have therefore to decide is whether clause (2) of article 19 stands in the way of the petitioners. "
STATUTE,"The East Punjab Public Safety Act, 1949, of which sec tion 7 is a part, was passed by the Provincial Legislature in exercise of the power conferred upon it by section 100 of the Government of India Act, 1935, is 611 read with Entry 1 of List II of the Seventh Schedule to that Act, which includes among other matters ""public order.""  "
REASONING,"This expression in the general sense may be construed to have reference to the maintenance of what is generally known as law and order in the Province, and this is confirmed by the words which follow it in Entry 1 of List II and which have been put within brackets, viz., ""but not including the use of naval, military or air forces or any other armed forces of the Union in aid of the civil power. "
REASONING,""" It is clear that anything which affects public tranquillity within the State or the Province will also affect public order and the State Legislature is therefore competent to frame laws on matters relating to public tranquillity and public order. "
STATUTE,"It was not disputed that under the Government of India Act, 1935 (under, which the impugned Act was passed) it was the responsibility of each Province to deal with all internal disorders whatever their magnitude may be and to preserve public tranquillity and order within the Province. "
REASONING,"This expression, though it has been variously used in different contexts (see the Indian Penal Code, Ch. XIV), has now acquired a well recognized meaning in relation to an Act like the impugned Act, as a result of a long course of legislative practice, and may be taken to denote safety or security of the State."
PRECEDENT,"The headnote of this case runs as follows ""By section 1 of the Defence of the Realm (Consolidation) Act, 1914, power was given to His Majesty in Council 'during the continuance of the present war to issue regulations  for securing the public safety and the defence of the realm ' : (1) 612 Held, that the regulations thereby authorized were not limited to regulations for the protection of the country against foreign enemies, but included regulations designed for the prevention of internal disorder and rebellion "" Thus 'public order ' and 'public safety ' are allied matters, but, in order to appreciate how they stand in relation to each other, it seems best to direct our atten tion to the opposite concepts which we may, for convenience of reference, respectively label as 'public disorder ' and 'public unsafety '. "
REASONING,"If 'public safety ' is, as we have seen, equivalent to 'security of the State ', what I have designated as public unsafety may be regarded as equivalent to 'insecurity of the State '. "
REASONING,"When we approach the matter in this way, we find that while 'public disorder ' iS wide enough to cover a small riot or an affray and other cases where peace is disturbed by, or affects, a small group of persons, 'public unsafety ' (or insecurity of the State), will usually be connected with serious internal disorders and such disturbances of public tranquillity as jeopardize the security of the State. "
REASONING,""" The prominence thus given to 'public safety ' strongly suggests that the Act was intended to deal with serious cases of public disorder which affect public safety or the security of the State, or cases in which, owing to some kind of emergency or a grave situation having arisen, even public disorders of comparatively small dimensions may have far reaching effects on the security of the State. "
REASONING,"It is to be noted that the Act purports to provide ""special measures to ensure public safety and maintenance of public order. "
REASONING,""" The words ""special measures"" are rather important, because they show that the Act was not intended for ordinary cases or ordinary situations. "
ARG,"The line of argument advanced on behalf of the petitioners is that since the Act has been passed in exercise of the power granted by the expression ""public order,"" used in the Government of India Act, which is a general term of wide import, and since it purports to provide for the maintenance of public order, its provisions are intended or are liable to be used for all cases of breaches of public order, be they small or insignificant breaches or those of a grave or serious nature. "
REASONING,The Act is a piece of special legislation providing for special measures and the central idea dominating it is public safety and maintenance of public order in a situation requiring special measures. 
ARG,"It was argued that ""public safety"" and ""maintenance of public order"" are used in the Act disjunctively and they are separated by the word ""or"" and not ""and,"" and therefore we cannot rule out the possibility of the Act providing for ordinary as well as serious cases of disturbance of public order and tranquillity."
REASONING,"This, as I have already indicated, is a somewhat narrow and technical approach to the question. "
REASONING,"We therefore cannot ignore the fact that preservation of public safety is the dominant purpose of the Act and that it is a special Act providing for special measures and therefore it should not be confused with an Act which is applicable to ordinary situations and to any and every trivial case of breach of public order, 614 In my opinion, the word ""or"" is used here not so much to separate two wholly different concepts as to show that they are closely allied concepts and can be used almost interchangeably in the context."
RPC,"I think that ""public order"" may well be paraphrased in the context as public tranquillity and the words ""public safety"" and ""public order"" may be read as equivalent to ""security of the State"" and ""public tranquillity."
REASONING,""" I will now advert once more to clause (2) of article 19 and state what I consider to be the reason for inserting in it the words ""matter which undermines the security of, or tends to overthrow, the State. "
PRECEDENT,"The latest pronouncement by the highest Indian tribunal as to the law of sedition is to be found in Niharendu Dutt Majumdar vs The King(1) which has been quoted again and again and in which Gwyer C.J. laid down that public disor der, or the reasonable anticipation or likelihood of public disorder, is the gist of the offence of sedition and ""the acts or words complained of must either incite to disorder or (1) 615 must be such as to satisfy reasonable men that is their intention or tendency. "
PRECEDENT,"Sullivan (1), and he also added that he was content to adopt ""the words of that learned Judge which are to be found in every book dealing with this branch of the criminal law."
PRECEDENT,""" There is no doubt that what Gwyer C.J. has stated in that case represents the view of a number of Judges and authors and was also the view of Sir James Stephen in regard to whom Cave J. in his charge to the jury in a case relating to the law of sedition JR. "
PRECEDENT,"vs Burns(2) said : ""The law upon the question of what is seditious and what is not is to be found stated very clearly in a book by Stephen J. who has undoubtedly a greater knowledge of crimi nal law than any other Judge who sits upon the Bench, and what he has said upon the subject of sedition was submitted to the other Judges, who sometime back were engaged with him in drafting a criminal code, and upon their report the Commissioners say that his statement of law appears to them to be stated accurately as it exists at present. "
PRECEDENT,""" The decision of Gwyer C.J. held the field for several years until the Privy Council, dealing with a case under the Defence of India Rules, expressed the view in King Emper or vs Sadhashiv Narayan Bhalerao(3) that the test laid down by the learned Chief Justice was not applicable in India where the offence under section 124A of the Indian Penal Code should be construed with reference to the words used in that section. "
PRECEDENT,(8) 74 I.A. 616 There can be no justification for restricting the contents of the section by the marginal note. 
REASONING,That sedition does undermine the security of the State is a matter which cannot admit of much doubt.
REASONING,That it undermines the security of the State usually through the medium of public disorder is also a matter on which eminent Judges and jurists are agreed. 
REASONING,Therefore it is difficult to hold that public disorder or disturbance of public tranquillity are not matters which undermine the security of the State.
REASONING,"Unlawful assemblies, riots, insurrections, rebellions, levying of war, are offences which run into each other, and are not capable of being marked off by perfectly definite boundaries, All of them have in common one feature, namely, that the normal tranquillity of a civilised society is in each of the cases mentioned disturbed either by actual force or at least by the show and threat of it. "
RPC,"Both these classes of offences are such as will undermine the security of the State or tend to overthrow it if left unchecked, and, as I have tried to point out, there is a good deal of authorita tive opinion in favour of the view that the gravity ascribed to sedition is due to the fact that it tends to seriously affect the tranquillity and security of the State."
RPC,"In principle, then, it would not have been logical to refer to sedition in clause (2) of article 19 and omit matters which are no less grave and which have equal potentiality for undermining the security of the State."
STATUTE,"It is needless to add that the word ""State"" has been defined in article 12 of the Constitution to include ""the Government and Parlia ment of India and the Government and Legislature of each of the States and all local or other authorities within the territory of India or under the control of the Government of India. "
REASONING,""" I find that section 20 of the impugned Act provides that the Provincial Government may by notification 619 declare that the whole or any part of the Province as may be specified in the notification is a dangerously disturbed area. "
REASONING,"This provision has some bearing on the aim and object of the Act, and we cannot overlook it when considering its scope. "
REASONING,"It may be incidentally mentioned that we have been informed that, under this section, Delhi Province has been notified to be a ""dangerously disturbed area."
REASONING,""" It must be recognized that freedom of speech and expression is one of the most valuable rights guaranteed to a citizen by the Constitution and should be jealously guard ed by the Courts. "
REASONING,""" But the Constitution itself has pre scribed certain limits for the exercise of the freedom of speech and expression and this Court is only called upon to see whether a particular case comes within those limits."
RPC,"In my opinion, the law which is impugned is fully saved by article 19 (2) and if it cannot be successfully assailed it is not possible to grant the remedy which the petitioners are seeking here."
FACTS,"As has been stated already, the order which is impugned in this case recites that the weekly Organizer has been publishing highly objectionable matter constituting a threat to public law and order"" and that the action which it is proposed to take against the petitioners ""is necessary for the purpose of preventing or combating activities prejudi cial to public safety or the maintenance of public order. "
FACTS,""" These facts are supported by an affidavit sworn by the Home Secretary to the Chief Commissioner, who also states among other things that the order in question was passed by the Chief Commissioner in consultation with the Central Press Advisory Committee, which is an independent body elected by the All India Newspaper Editors ' Conference and is composed of 620 representatives of some of the leading papers such as The Hindustan Times, Statesman, etc. "
RPC,"In my opinion, there can be no doubt that the Chief Commissioner has purported to act in this case within the sphere within which he is permitted to act under the law, and it is beyond the power of this Court to grant the reliefs claimed by the petitioners."
RPC,"In these circumstances, I would dismiss the petitioners ' application. "
RPC,Petition allowed.
NAME,"Keshavan Madhava Menon vs The State Of Bombay on 22 January, 1951"
CITATION,"Equivalent citations: 1951 AIR 128, 1951 SCR 228"
COUNSEL,"A.S.R. Chari, for the appellant."
COUNSEL,"M.C. Setalvad, Attorney General for India (G. N. Joshi, with him) for the respondent."
JUDGE,"The judgment of Kania C.J., Patanjali Sastri J. Das J. and Chandrasekhara Aiyar J. was delivered by Das J. Mahajan J. and Fazl Ali J. delivered separate judgments."
FACTS,"At all material times the petitioner, who is the appellant before us, was the Secretary of People 's Publish ing House, Ltd., a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act with its registered office at 190 B, Khetwadi Main Road in Bombay."
FACTS,"In September, 1949, a pamphlet entitled ""Railway Mazdooron ke khilaf Nai Zazish"" is alleged to have been published in Bombay by the petitioner as the secretary of that company."
FACTS,"Learned counsel for the peti tioner states that the pamphlet was published as a ""book"" within the meaning of section 1 of the Press and Registra tion of Books Act (XXV of 1867) and that the provisions of that Act had been duly complied 230 with."
FACTS,"The Bombay Government authorities, however, took the view that the pamphlet was a ""news sheet"" within the meaning of section 2 (6) of the Indian Press (Emergency Powers) Act, 1931, and that as it had been published without the authori ty required by section 15 (1) of that Act, the petitioner had committed an offence punishable under section 18 (1) of the same Act."
FACTS,"A prosecution under that Act was accordingly started against the petitioner in the Court of the Chief Presidency Magistrate, Bombay, and was registered as Case No. 1102/P of 1949."
FACTS,"During the pendency of the proceedings the Constitution of India came into force on January 26, 1950."
FACTS,"On March 3, 1950, the petitioner filed a written statement submitting, inter alia, that the definition of ""news sheet"" as given in section 2 (6) of the Indian Press (Emergency Powers) Act, 1931, and sections 15 and 18 thereof were ultra vires and void in view of article 19(1)(a) read with article 13 and that the hearing of the case should be stayed till the High Court decided that question of law."
FACTS,"This was followed up by a petition filed in the High Court on March 7, 1950, under article 228 of the Constitution, praying that the record of Case No. 1102/P of 1949 be sent for, that it be declared that sections 15 and 18 read with section 2 (6) and (10), in so far as they create liability for restrictive measure for a citizen, are ultra vires of article 19 (1) (a)and are, therefore, void and inoperative and that the petitioner be ordered to be acquitted."
FACTS,"During the pendency of this petition the Chief Presidency Magis trate on March 23, 1950, framed a charge against the peti tioner under section 18 of the Press (Emergency Powers) Act, 1931."
FACTS,"The petition under article 228 was heard on April 12, 1950, by a Bench of the Bombay High Court consisting of Chagla C.J. and Bavdekar and Shah JJ."
FACTS,"Two questions were raised before the Bench, namely (1) Whether sections 15 (1) and 18 (1) read with the definitions contained in sections 2 (6) and 2 (.10) of the Indian Press (Emergency Powers) Act, 1931, were 231 inconsistent with article 19 (1) (a) read with clause (2) of that article ? and (2) Assuming that they were inconsistent, whether the proceedings commenced under section 18 (1) of that Act before the commencement of the Constitution could neverthe less be proceeded with ? The High Court considered it unnecessary to deal with or decide the first question and disposed of the application only on the second question."
RLC,"The High Court took the view that the word ""void"" was used in article 13 (1) in the sense of ""repealed"" and that consequently it attracted section 6 of the General Clauses Act, which Act by article 367 was made applicable for the interpretation of the Constitution."
RLC,"The High Court, therefore, reached the conclusion that proceedings under the Indian Press (Emergency Powers) Act, 1931, which were pending at the date of the commence ment of the Constitution were not affected, even if the Act were inconsistent with the fundamental rights conferred by article 19 (1)(a)and as such became void under article 13 (1) of the Constitution after January 26, 1950."
RLC,The High Court accordingly answered the second question in the af firmative and dismissed the petitioner 's application.
ARG,"Learned counsel appearing in support of this appeal urged that the Indian Press (Emergency Powers) Act, 1931, was one of the many repressive laws enacted by an alien Government with a view to stifle the liberty of the Indian subjects and particularly of the Indian Press; that, with the advent of independence the people of India began to breathe freely and by the Constitution which they gave unto themselves they took care to guarantee to themselves the fundamental rights of free citizens of a democratic republic and that article 13 (1) of that Constitution brushed aside all vestiges of subordination which the tyranny of the alien rulers had imposed upon them and declared all 232 laws inconsistent with the fundamental rights to be void as if they had never been passed and had never existed."
ARG,"It was, therefore, against the spirit of the Constitution, argued the learned counsel, that a free citizen of India should still continue to be persecuted under such a retro grade law which, being inconsistent with the fundamental rights, must be declared to be void."
ARG,"Learned counsel urged that it was not necessary for him to contend that such inconsistent laws became void ab initio or that all past and closed transactions could be reopened but he contended that on and from January 26, 1950, when the Constitution came into force such inconsistent laws which became void could not be looked at for any purpose and far less could they be utilised for the purpose of framing a charge or punishing a free citizen."
ARG,"As the void law cannot be utilised any long er, the pending prosecutions, according to learned counsel, must fall to the ground."
ARG,"To permit pending proceedings under a law which, after the commencement of the Constitu tion had become void, to proceed further, after the Consti tution has taken effect, is to prolong the efficacy of the law notwithstanding that it has become void on and from the date the Constitution came into force and that is against the spirit of the Constitution."
REASONING,"An argument founded on what is claimed to be the spirit of the Constitution is always attractive, for it has a powerful appeal to sentiment and emotion; but a court of law has to gather the spirit of the Constitution from the lan guage of the Constitution."
REASONING,What one may believe or think to be the spirit of the Constitution cannot prevail if the language of the Constitution does not support that view.
STATUTE,Article 372 (2) gives power to the President to adapt and modify existing laws by way of repeal or amendment.
STATUTE,"There is nothing to prevent the President, in exercise of the powers conferred on him by that article, from repealing, say the whole or any part of the Indian Press (Emergency Powers) Act, 1931."
STATUTE,"If the President does so, then such repeal will at once attract section 6 of the General Clauses Act."
STATUTE,"In such a situation all prosecutions under 233 the Indian Press (Emergency Powers) Act, 1931, which were pending at the date of its repeal by the President would be saved and must be proceeded with notwithstanding the repeal of that Act unless an express provision was otherwise made in the repealing Act."
REASONING,It is therefore clear that the idea of the preservation of past inchoate rights or liabili ties and pending proceedings to enforce the same is not foreign or abhorrent to the Constitution of India.
REASONING,"We are, therefore, unable to accept the contention about the spirit of the Constitution as invoked by the learned counsel in aid of his plea that pending proceedings under a law which has become void cannot be proceeded with."
REASONING,"Further, if it is against the spirit of the Constitution to continue the pending prosecutions under such a void law, surely it should be equally repugnant to that spirit that men who have al ready been convicted under such repressive law before the Constitution of India came into force should continue to rot in jail."
REASONING,"It is, therefore, quite clear that the court should construe the language of article 13(1) according to the established rules of interpretation and arrive at its true meaning uninfluenced by any assumed spirit of the Constitu tion."
STATUTE,"Article 13 (1) with which we are concerned for the pur poses of this application is in these terms: ""All laws in force in the territory of India immediately before the commencement of this Constitution, in so far as they are inconsistent with the provisions of this Part, shall, to the extent of such inconsistency, be void."
STATUTE,""" It will be noticed that all that this clause declares is that all existing laws, in so far as they are inconsistent with the provisions of Part II1 shall, to the extent of such inconsistency, be void."
REASONING,Every statute is prima facie pro spective unless it is expressly or by necessary implications made to have retrospective operation.
REASONING,There is no reason why this rule of interpretation should not be applied for the purpose of interpreting our Constitution.
REASONING,We find nothing in the language of article 13 (1) which may be read as indicating an 234 intention to give it retrospective operation.
REASONING,"On the con trary, the language clearly points the other way."
REASONING,The provi sions of Part III guarantee what are called fundamental rights.
REASONING,"Indeed, the heading of Part III is ""Fundamental Rights""."
REASONING,"These rights are given, for the first time, by and under our Constitution."
REASONING,Before the Constitution came into force there was no such thing as fundamental right.
STATUTE,What article 13(1) provides is that all existing laws which clash with the exercise of the fundamental rights (which are for the first time created by the Constitution) shall to that extent be void.
REASONING,As the fundamental rights became operative only on and from the date of the Constitution the question of the inconsistency of the existing laws with those rights must necessarily arise on and from the date those rights came into being.
REASONING,"It must follow, therefore, that article 13(1) can have no retrospective effect but is wholly pro spective in its operation."
REASONING,"After this first point is noted, it should further be seen that article 13 (1) does not in terms make the existing laws which are inconsistent with the fundamental rights void ab initio or for all purposes."
REASONING,"On the contrary, it provides that all existing laws, in so far as they are inconsistent with the fundamental rights, shall be void to the extent of their inconsistency."
REASONING,They are not void for all purposes but they are void only to the extent they come into conflict with the fundamental rights.
REASONING,"In other words, on and after the commencement of the Constitu tion no existing law will be permitted to stand in the way of the exercise of any of the fundamental rights."
REASONING,"Therefore, the voidness of the existing law is limited to the future exercise of the fundamental rights."
REASONING,"Article 13(1) cannot be read as obliterating the entire operation of the inconsist ent laws, or to wipe them out altogether from the statute book, for to do so will be to give them retrospective effect which, we have said, they do not possess."
REASONING,Such laws exist for all past transactions and for enforcing all rights and liabilities accrued before the date of the Constitution.
REASONING,"Learned counsel for the appellant has drawn our attention to articles 249 (3), 250, 357, 358 235 and 369 where express provision has been made for saving things done under the laws which expired."
REASONING,It will be no ticed that each of those articles was concerned with expiry of temporary statutes.
REASONING,"It is well known that on the expiry of a temporary statute no further proceedings can be taken under it, unless the statute itself saved pending proceed ings."
REASONING,"If therefore, an offence had been committed under a temporary statute and the proceedings were initiated but the offender had not been prosecuted and punished before the expiry of the statute, then, in the absence of any saving clause, the pending prosecution could not be proceeded with after the expiry of the statute by efflux of time."
REASONING,It was on this principle that express provision was made in the several articles noted above for saving things done or omitted to be done under the expiring laws referred to therein.
REASONING,"As explained above, article 13 (1) is entirely prospective in its operation and as it was not intended to have any retrospective effect there was no necessity at all for inserting in that article any such saving clause."
REASONING,The effect of article 13 (1) is quite different from the effect of the expiry of a temporary statute or the repeal of a statute by a. subsequent statute.
REASONING,"As already explained, article 13 (1) only has the effect of nullifying or rendering all inconsistent existing laws ineffectual or nugatory and devoid of any legal force or binding effect only with respect to the exercise of fundamental rights on and after the date of the commencement of the Constitution."
REASONING,"It has no retrospective effect and if, therefore, an act was done before the commencement of the Constitution in contra vention of the provisions of any law which, after the Con stitution, becomes void with respect to the exercise of any of the fundamental rights, the inconsistent law is not wiped out so far as the past act is concerned, for, to say that it is, will be to give the law retrospective effect."
REASONING,There is No. fundamental right that a person shall not be prosecuted and punished for an offence committed before the Constitu tion came into force.
REASONING,"So far as the past acts 31 236 are concerned the law exists, notwithstanding that it does not exist with respect to the future exercise of fundamental rights."
REASONING,"We, therefore, agree with the conclusion arrived at by the High Court on the second question, although on dif ferent grounds."
RPC,"In view of that conclusion, we do not consider it necessary to examine the reasons of the High Court for its conclusion."
RPC,"In our opinion, therefore, this appeal fails, and is dismissed."
REASONING,"On the 9th December, 1949, the appel lant was arrested and a prosecution was started against him under section 18(1) of the Indian Press (Emergency Powers) Act (XXIII of 1931) in the Court of the Chief Presidency Magistrate at Bombay for publishing a pamphlet in Urdu entitled ""Railway Mazdoorun Ke Khilaf Nai Sazish."
REASONING,""" The prosecution case was that the pamphlet was a news sheet within the meaning of section 2(6) of the Act and that since it had been published without the authority required by section 1.5(1) of the Act, the appellant had committed an offence punishable under section 18(1) of the Act."
REASONING,"While the prosecution was pending, the Constitution of India came into force on the 26th January, 1950, and thereafter the appel lant raised the contention that sections 2(6), 15 and 18 of the Act were void, being inconsistent with article 19(1) (a) of the Constitution and therefore the case against him could not proceed."
REASONING,"Having raised this contention, the appellant filed a petition in the High Court at Bombay under article 228 of the Constitution asking the High Court to send for the record of the case and declare that sections 15 and 18of the Indian Press (Emergency Powers) Act read with section 2(6) and (10) thereof were void and inoperative and the petitioner should be ordered to be acquitted."
REASONING,"The petition was heard by a Full Bench of the Bombay High Court, and the learned Judges constituting the Bench, in 237 deciding the point raised, assumed that the provisions of the Act impugned by the appellant were inconsistent with the fundamental right guaranteed by article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution of India, and held that article 13(1) had virtually the effect of repealing such provisions of existing laws as were inconsistent with any of the fundamental rights and that consequently under section 6 of the General Clauses Act, which is made applicable for the interpretation of the Constitution by article 367, pending proceedings were not affected."
REASONING,"The appellant 's petition to the High Court having been dismissed, he preferred this appeal in the Supreme Court."
REASONING,One of the points discussed elaborately by the learned counsel appearing for the parties in the course of their arguments was as to what was the effect upon pending pro ceedings when an Act was repealed or when a temporary Act expired.
REASONING,"In Craies on Statute Law, the effect of the expiry of a temporary Act is stated to be as follows : ""As a general rule, and unless it contains some special provision to the contrary, after a temporary Act has expired no proceedings can be taken upon it, and it ceases to have any further effect."
REASONING,"Therefore, offences committed against temporary Acts must be prosecuted and punished before the Act expires, and as soon as the Act expires any proceedings which are being taken against a person will ipso facto terminate."" (4th Ed., pp. 347 348)."
PRECEDENT,"This statement of law by Craies was referred to with approval and adopted by the Federal Court in J.K. Gas Plant Manufacturing Co., (Rampur) Ltd., and Others vs King Emper or."
REASONING,"(1) As to the effect of the repeal of an Act, the fol lowing passage from Craies book seems to sum up the legal position as it obtained in England before the enactment of the Interpretation Act of 1889 : ""When an Act of Parliament is repealed,"" said Lord Tenterden in Surtees vs Ellison(2) ""it must be at 166."
REASONING,(2) 238 considered (except as to transactions past and closed) as if it had never existed.
REASONING,That is the general rule.
REASONING,""" Tindal C.J. states the exception more widely."
PRECEDENT,"He says (in Kay vs Goodwin)(1): ,, The effect of repealing a statute is to obliterate it as completely from the records of the Parlia ment as if it had never been passed;and it must be consid ered as a law that never existed except for the purpose of those actions which were commenced, prosecuted and concluded whilst it was an existing law."" (P. 350)."
REASONING,"Again, Crawford in his book on ""Statutory Construction"" dealing with the general effect of the repeal of an Act states the law in America to be as follows: ' 'A repeal will generally, therefore, divest all incho ate rights which have arisen under the repealed statute, and destroy all accrued causes of action based thereon."
REASONING,"As a result, such a repeal, without a saving clause, will destroy any proceedings whether not yet begun, or whether pending at the time of the enactment of the repealing Act, and not already prosecuted to a final judgment so as to create a vested right."" (Pp."
REASONING,"In a footnote relating to the cases which the learned author cites in support of the above proposition, he adds: ""See Cleveland, etc., R. Co. vs Mumford (Ind.)(2) where the repeal of a statute during the trial prevented a judg ment from being rendered."
REASONING,"Similarly, there can be no legal conviction for an offence, unless the act be contrary to law at the time it is committed; nor can there be a judgment, unless the law is in force at the time of the indictment and judgment."
REASONING,"If the law ceases to operate, by its own limita tion or by a repeal, at any time before judgment, no judg ment can be given."
REASONING,"Hence, it is usual in every repealing law to make it operate prospectively only, and to insert a a saving clause, preventing the retroactive operation of the repeal and continuing the repealed law in force as to all pending prosecutions, and often as to all violations of the existing law already committed."" (1) ; (2) 239 The author then proceeds to quote the following passage from Wall vs Chesapeake & Ohio Ry."
REASONING,", Company (1): ""It is well settled that if a statute giving a special remedy is repealed without a saving clause in favour of pending suits all suits must stop where the repeal finds them."
REASONING,"If final relief has not been granted before the repeal went into effect, it cannot be after."
REASONING,"If a case is appealed, and pending the appeal the law is changed, the appellate court must dispose of the case under the law in force when its decision was rendered."
REASONING,"The effect of the repeal is to obliterate the statute repealed as completely as if it bad never been passed, and it must be considered as a law which never existed, except for the purposes of those actions or suits which were commenced, prosecuted and con cluded while it was an existing law."
REASONING,Pending judicial pro ceedings based upon a statute cannot proceed after its repeal.
REASONING,"This rule holds true until the proceedings have reached a final judgment in the court of last resort, for that court, when it comes to announce its decision, conforms it to the law then existing, and may therefore reverse a judgment which was correct when pronounced in the subordi nate tribunal from whence the appeal was taken, if it ap pears that pending the appeal a statute which was necessary to support the judgment of the lower court has been with drawn by an absolute repeal."" (P. 601)."
REASONING,It is well known that formerly the practice in England used to be to insert in most of the repealing statutes a clause saving anything duly done or suffered under the repealed statutes and any pending legal proceeding or inves tigations.
REASONING,"Ultimately, to dispense with the necessity of having to insert a saving clause in almost every repealing Act, section 38 (2) was inserted in the Interpretation Act, 1889, which provides that a repeal, unless the con trary intention appears, does not affect the previous opera tion of the repealed enactment or anything duly done or suffered under it and any investigations, legal proceedings or (1) 125 N.E.20."
REASONING,"240 remedies may be instituted, continued or enforced in respect of rights, liabilities and penalties under the ;repealed Act, as if the repealing Act had not been passed."
REASONING,"Crawford in his book to which I have referred adverts in these words to a similar difficulty which was experienced in America and to the manner in which it has been met: ""Due to the numerous troublesome problems which constantly arose with the repeal of statutes, as well as to the numerous cases where hardship was caused, statutes have been enacted in several States expressly providing that the repeal of a statute shall not affect any rights, causes of action, penalties, forfeitures, and pending suits, accrued or instituted under the repealed statute."" In India, the earliest attempt that was made to guard against the normal legal effect of a repeal is to be found in section 6 of Act I of 1868."
REASONING,This provision was further elaborated by section 6 of the General Clauses Act of 1897 which is on the same lines as section 38 (2)of the Interpre tation Act of England.
REASONING,The position therefore now in India as well as in England is that a repeal has not the drastic effect which it used to have before the enactment of the Interpretation Act in England or the General Clauses Act in this country.
REASONING,But this is due entirely to the fact that an express provision has been made in those enactments to counteract that effect.
REASONING,"Hence, in those cases which are not covered by the language of the General Clauses Act, the principle already enunciated will continue to operate."
REASONING,"The learned AttorneyGeneral had to concede that it was doubtful whether section 6 of that Act is applicable where there is a repeal by implication, and there can be no doubt that the law as to the effect of the expiry of a temporary statute still remains as stated in the books, because sec tion 6 of the General Clauses Act and section 38 (2) of the Interpretation Act have no application except where an Act is repealed."
REASONING,"It should be remembered 241 that the soundness of the law which has been consistently applied to cases governed by statutes which have ceased to be in force, by reason of having been repealed or having expired, has never been questioned, and it cannot be brushed aside as if it embodied some archaic or obsolete rule pecul iar only to the common law of England."
REASONING,It is the law which has been enunciated by eminent Judges both in England and in America and is based on good sense and reason.
REASONING,"I shall now proceed to consider what would be the cor rect legal position, when a provision of an existing law is held to be void under article 13 (1) of the Constitution."
REASONING,"From the earlier proceedings before the Constituent Assem bly, it appears that in the original draft of the Constitu tion, the words ""shall stand abrogated"" were used instead of ""shall be void,"" in article 13 (1), and one of the questions directly before the Assembly was what would be the effect of the use of those words upon pending proceedings and anything duly done or suffered under the existing law."
REASONING,"Ultimately, the article emerged in the form in which it stands at present, and the words ""shall stand abrogated"" were replaced by the words ""shall be void."
REASONING,""" If the words ""stand abrogated"" had been there, it would have been possible to argue that those words would have the same effect as repeal and would attract section 6 of the General Clauses Act, but those words have been abandoned and a very strong expression, indeed the strongest expression which could be used, has been used in their place."
REASONING,"The meaning of the word ""void"" is stated in Black 's Law Dictionary (3rd Edn.) to be as fol lows: ""null and void; ineffectual; nugatory; having no legal force or binding effect;unable in law to support the purpose for which it was intended; nugatory and ineffectual so that nothing can cure it; not valid."
REASONING,""" A reference to the Constitution will show that the framers thereof have used the word ""repeal"" wherever neces sary (see articles 252, 254, 357, 372 and 395)."
REASONING,"They have also used such words as ""invalid"" (see 242 articles 245, 255 and 276), ""cease to have effect"" (see articles 358 and 372), ' 'shall be inoperative"", etc."
REASONING,"They have used the word ""void"" only in two articles, these being article 13 (1) and article 154, and both these articles deal with cases where a certain law is repugnant to another law to which greater sanctity is attached."
REASONING,"It further appears that where they wanted to save things done or omitted to be done under the existing law, they have used apt language for the purpose; see for example articles 249, 250,357, 358 and 369."
REASONING,"The thoroughness and precision which the framers of the Constitution have observed in the matters to which reference has been made, disinclines me to read into article 13 (1) a saving provision of the kind which we are asked to read into it."
REASONING,Nor can I be persuaded to hold that treating an Act as void under article 13 (1) should have a milder effect upon transactions not past and closed than the repeal of an Act or its expiry in due course of time.
REASONING,"In my opin ion, the strong sense in which the word ""void"" is normally used and the context in which it has been used are not to be completely ignored."
REASONING,"Evidently, the framers of the Constitu tion did not approve of the laws which are in conflict with the fundamental rights, and, in my judgment, it would not be giving full effect to their intention to hold that even after the Constitution has come into force, the laws which are inconsistent with the fundamental rights will continue to be treated as good and effectual laws in regard to cer tain matters, as if the Constitution had never been passed."
REASONING,"How such a meaning can be read into the words used in arti cle 13 (1), it is difficult for me to understand."
REASONING,"There can be no doubt that article 13 (1)will have no retrospective operation, and transactions which are past and closed, and rights which have already vested, will remain untouched."
REASONING,"But with regard to inchoate matters which were still not determined when the Constitution came into force, and as regards proceedings whether not yet begun, or pending at the time of the enforcement of the Constitution and not yet prosecuted to a final judgment, the very serious question arises as to whether a law which 243 has been declared by the Constitution to be completely ineffectual can yet be applied."
REASONING,"On principle and on good authority, the answer to this question would appear to me to be that the law having ceased to be effectual can no longer be applied."
PRECEDENT,"In R. vs Mawgan (Inhabitants)(1) a presentment as to the non repair of a highway had been made under 13 Geo. 3, c. 78, section 24, but before the case came on to be tried, the Act was repealed."
REASONING,"In that case, Lord Denman C.J. said: ""If the question had related merely to the present ment, that no doubt is complete."
REASONING,"But dum loquimur, we have lost the power of giving effect to anything that takes place under that proceeding."" And Littledale J. added: ""/do not say that what is already done has become bad, but that no more can be done."" In my opinion, this is precisely the way in which we should deal with the present case."
REASONING,"It was argued at the Bar that the logical outcome of such a view would be to hold that all the convictions al ready recorded and all the transactions which are closed, should be reopened, but, in my opinion, to argue on these lines is to overlook what has been the accepted law for centuries, namely, that when a law is treated as dead, transactions which are past and closed cannot be revived and actions which were commenced, prosecuted and concluded whilst the law was operative cannot be reopened."
REASONING,"In the course of the arguments, a doubt was also raised as to what would be 'the effect in the case of an appeal pending when the Constitution came into force, from a con viction already recorded before the 26th January, 1950."
REASONING,"The law applicable to such a situation is well known and has been correctly summed up by Crawford in these words: ""Pending judicial proceedings based upon a statute cannot proceed after its repeal."
REASONING,"The rule holds true until the proceedings have reached a final judgment in the court of last resort, for that court, when it comes to announce its decision, conforms it to the law then existing, and may therefore reverse a judgment which was (1) ; 244 correct when pronounced in the subordinate tribunal from whence the appeal was taken, if it appears that pending the."
REASONING,appeal a statute which was necessary to support the judgment of the lower court has been withdrawn by an abso lute repeal.
REASONING,""" I think I should at this stage deal briefly with two points which were raised in the course of the arguments in support of the opposite view."
REASONING,"It was urged in the first place that without there being a saving clause to govern article 13 (1), it can be so construed as to permit offences committed prior to the 26th January, 1950, to be punished."
REASONING,The argument has been put forward more or less in the fol lowing form.
REASONING,"The law which is said to be in conflict with the fundamental rights was a good law until the 25th January, and, since article 13 (1) is to be construed prospectively, and not retrospectively, every act constituting an offence under the old law remains an offence and can be punished even after the 26th January."
REASONING,It seems to me that the same argument could be urged with reference to matters which constituted offences under a repealed Act or a temporary Act which has expired.
REASONING,But such an argument has never succeeded.
REASONING,The real question is wheth er a person who has not been convicted before the Act has ceased to exist or ceased to be effectual can still be prosecuted under such an Act.
REASONING,"The answer to this question has always been in the negative, and I do not see why a different answer should be given in the case of an Act which has be come void, i.e., which has become so ineffectual that it cannot be cured."
REASONING,"The second argument which also has failed to impress me is that if section 6 of the General Clauses Act does not in terms apply, the principle underlying that section should be applied."
REASONING,"The answer to this argument is that the Legislature in its wisdom has confined that section to a very definite situation, and, though it was open to it to make the section more comprehensive and general, it has not done so."
REASONING,"It is well known that situations similar to those which arise by reason of the repeal of an Act have arisen in regard to Acts 245 which have expired or Acts which have been declared to be void, and, though such situations must have been well known to the Legislature, they have not been provided for."
REASONING,"In these circumstances,I do not see how the very clear and definite provision can be enlarged in the manner in which it is attempted to be enlarged."
REASONING,"Besides, I have not come across any case in which the principle underlying section 38 (2) of the Interpretation Act or section 6 of the General Clauses Act has been invoked or applied."
REASONING,"In the present case, we have to look at the state of the law at the time when the question arises as to whether a person has committed any offence."
REASONING,"If we find that the law which made the act an offence has become completely ineffec tual and nugatory, then neither can a charge be framed nor can the accused person be convicted."
REASONING,"In my opinion, if the assumption on which the High Court has proceeded is correct, the appellant is entitled to a declaration that he cannot be convicted for the offence of which he is accused."
REASONING,"The appellant is the secretary of the Peo ple 's Publishing House Ltd., Bombay."
REASONING,"In September, 1949, he published a pamphlet entitled ""Railway Mazdoorum Ke Khilaf Nai Sazish."
REASONING,"""On the 9th December, 1949, he was arrested and a prosecution was launched against him under section 18 (1) of the Indian Press (Emergency Powers) Act (XXIII of 1931)in the Court of the Chief Presidency Magistrate at Bombay in respect of this pamphlet, as it had been published without any authority as required under section 16 of the said Act."
REASONING,"On the 8th March, 1950, an application was made on his behalf in the High Court of Judicature at Bombay under article 228 of the Constitution of India for quashing the proceedings started against him and it was contended that sections 16 and 18 of Act XXIII of 1931 were ultra vires of Part III of the Constitution of India and were thus void and had no effect whatsoever and no prosecution launched under these sections could be proceeded with after the coming into force of the Constitution."
REASONING,"The High Court refused this 246 application and held that the proceedings instituted against the appellant before the commencement of the Constitution could not be affected by the provisions of the Constitution that came into force on the 26th January, 1950."
REASONING,"Dissatis fied with this decision, the appellant has preferred the present appeal to this court."
REASONING,"The sole point to decide in the appeal is whether pro ceedings instituted under section 18 (1) of the Indian Press (Emergency Powers) Act, XXIII of 1931, before the commence ment of the Constitution of India are affected by its provi sions."
REASONING,"The High Court has answered this question in the negative and, in my opinion, rightly."
REASONING,I am in respectful agreement with the observations of the learned Chief Justice of Bombay that it is difficult to believe that the Constituent Assembly contemplated that with regard to the laws which it was declaring to be void under article 13 all vested rights and all proceedings taken should be disturbed and affected by particular laws ceasing to be in force as a result of inconsistencies with the fundamental rights guaranteed to the citizens.
REASONING,It is not arguable and was not argued that Part III of the Constitu tion has any retrospective operation.
REASONING,"The appellant was not possessed of any fundamental rights in September, 1949, when he published the pamphlet in question and his act clearly came within the mischief of the provisions of section 18 of Act XXIII of 1931 and he thus became liable to the penalties prescribed therein."
REASONING,"It was, however, contended by Mr. Chari, the learned counsel for the appellant, that the effect of the language employed in article 13 (1)of the Constitution was that the proceedings commenced before the coming into force of the Constitution could not be continued after its commencement under the laws that became inconsistent with its provisions."
REASONING,"For this proposition he placed reliance on the rule of construction stated in Maxwell on ""Interpretation of Stat utes "", p. 404, which is to the following effect : 247 ""Where an Act expired or was repealed, it was formerly regarded, in the absence of provision to the contrary, as having never existed, except as to matters and transactions passed and closed."
REASONING,"Where, therefore, a penal law was broken, the offender could not be punished under it if it expired before he was convicted, although the prosecution was begun while the Act was still in force."
REASONING,""" This rule seems to be based on a statement of Tindal C.J. in Kay vs Goodwin(1)."
REASONING,"The learned Chief Justice made the following observations : ""I take the effect of repealing a statute to be, to obliterate it as completely from the records of Parliament as if it had never been passed; and it must be considered as a law that never existed except for the purpose of those actions which were commenced, prosecuted and concluded whilst it was an existing laW."" This was the rule of the English common law which was applied in cases of statutes which were repealed and under this rule all pending actions and prosecutions could not be proceeded with after the repeal of the law under which they were started."
REASONING,"This rule was however changed by the Inter pretation Act of 1889, section 38."
REASONING,"Therein it was enacted that unless the contrary intention appears, no repeal is to affect any investigation, legal proceeding, including the initiation of criminal proceedings, or remedy in respect of any such right, privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture, or punishment and any such investigation, legal proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or enforced and any such penalty, forfeiture or punishment may be imposed as if the repealing Act had not been passed."
REASONING,A similar provision exists in India in section 6 of the Gener al Clauses Act of 1868 and 1897.
RLC,"The High Court held that the provisions of article 13(1) were analogous to the repeal of a statute and therefore section 6 of the General Clauses Act had application to the construction of these provisions and that being so, the coming into force of the Constitution did (1) ; 180 E.R. 1403; 248 not in any way affect the continuance of the proceedings that had been commenced against the appellant under the law that was in force at the time of the publication of the pamphlet."
REASONING,Mr. Chari contended that the High Court was in error in applying the provisions of section 6 of the General Clauses Act to the interpretation of article 13 (1) of the Constitution inasmuch as the provisions of this article were not analogous to repeal and did not amount to a repeal of the existing law.
REASONING,"He contended that a repeal of the law could only be by the legislature but that under article 13 power had been given to the court to declare any law incon sistent with the Constitution to be void; in other words, the power given was larger in scope and effect than the power of repeal and the effect of the declaration that a certain statute was void as it was repugnant to the freedom guaranteed by the Constitution was to wipe out the statute altogether from the date of the coming into force of the Constitution and that nothing could be done under that statute with effect from the 26th January, 1950, and there fore the court could not frame a charge under the law that was declared void, or pass a judgment of conviction against a person under a law that had been declared void."
REASONING,Mr. Chari went to the length of saying that a statute which was incon sistent with the Constitution became dead on the coming into force of the Constitution and under a dead statute no action could be taken whatsoever.
REASONING,He emphasised his contention by stressing the fact that freedoms guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution could not be tainted by keeping alive prosecutions and actions under laws framed by a foreign government which were inconsistent with those freedoms.
REASONING,It was said that some of the laws which the Constitution in tended to be declared void by the court because of their repugnancy to the fundamental rights guaranteed to the citizen by the Constitution were those which a foreign government had enacted to keep the people of this country under its domination and that to continue prosecutions under these laws after the coming into force of the Constitution would be wholly contrary and 249 repugnant not only to the letter of the Constitution but also to its spirit.
REASONING,It was conceded that transactions finally closed under such laws could not be reopened but that prosecutions and actions which were still continuing should be stopped and further action concerning them would become illegal and would be contrary to the freedoms guaran teed by the Constitution.
REASONING,"Reference was made to articles 249, 250, 357, 358, and 369 to show that the scheme of the Constitution was that wherever it intended that the proceed ings commenced under existing laws which became inoperative on the 26th January, 1950."
REASONING,"were to continue after that date, apt phraseology had been used to indicate that intention but that in article 13 no such saving words were used and there fore it must be presumed that the Constituent Assembly did not intend that proceedings taken under such laws were to be continued after the 26th January, 1950."
REASONING,"Article 13 (1) of the Constitution is in these terms : ""All laws in force in the territory of India immediately before the commencement of this Constitution, in so far as they are inconsistent with the provisions of this Part, shall, to the extent of such inconsistency, be void. ' ' The freedom guaranteed to the citizen which has applica tion to the case of the appellant is in article 19 (1) (a) and this article is in these terms : ""All citizens shall have the right to freedom of speech and expression."
REASONING,""" It is admitted that after the 26th January, 1950, there has been no infringement of the appellant 's right of freedom of speech or expression."
REASONING,"In September, 1949, he did not enjoy either complete freedom of speech or full freedom of expression."
REASONING,It is in relation to the freedom guaranteed in article 19(1) of the Constitution to the citizen that the provisions of article 13 (1) come into play.
REASONING,This article does not declare any law void independently of the existence of the freedoms guaranteed by Part III.
REASONING,"A citizen must be possessed 250 of a fundamental right before he can ask the court to de clare a law which is inconsistent with it void ;but if a citizen is not possessed of the right, he cannot claim this relief."
REASONING,"The appellant in the present case was not possessed of any fundamental right on the day that he published the pamphlet and in these circumstances the question is whether he can claim protection under the rights guaranteed to him on 26th January, 1950, for escaping the consequence of his act on any principles of construction of statutes."
REASONING,"Accord ing to the contention of the learned counsel, the principles applicable to repealed statutes are not in terms applicable to such a case, whether they are to be found in the rules of the common law of England or whether they are contained in the Interpretation Act or the General Clauses Act."
REASONING,Those rules are applicable to cases either of repeal or to cases of a statute dying a natural death by efflux of time.
REASONING,None of those however have any application to the construction of statutes framed in languages like the one contained in article 13 (1) of the Constitution.
REASONING,Besides the rule of construction which applies to repealed statutes or to tempo rary statutes our attention was not drawn to any other rule of construction under which a person who commits an offence against an Act during its existence as a law becomes unpun ishable on its termination.
REASONING,Both on considerations of con venience and also on grounds of justice and reason I am inclined to think that penalties incurred under a law in force at the time when the act was committed would survive its extinction so that persons who violate its provisions might afterwards be punished.
REASONING,Persons who during the contin uance of a statute have obtained rights under it cannot be affected by a declaration that the statute with effect from a certain date will become an inoperative statute.
REASONING,"When in the case of repeal of a statute, which according to Tindal C.J. obliterates it completely from the records of Parlia ment as if it had never been passed, the common law rule has been abrogated by statute, it is difficult to apply that rule on any sentimental grounds at this date to the case of statutes which are declared void or declared to have 251 no effect whatsoever after a certain date only."
REASONING,"The expres sion ""void"" has no larger effect on the statute so declared than the word ""repeal""."
REASONING,"The expression ""repeal"" according to common law rule obliterates a statute completely as if it had never been passed and thus operates retrospectively on past transactions in the absence of a saving clause or in the absence of provisions such as are contained in the Interpretation Act, 1889, or in the , while a provision in a statute that with effect from a particular date an existing law would be void to the extent of the repugnancy has no such retrospective operation and cannot affect pending prosecutions or actions taken under such laws."
REASONING,There is in such a situation no necessity of introducing a saving clause and it does not need the aid of a legislative provision of the nature contained in the Interpretation Act or the .
REASONING,To hold that a prospective declaration that a statute is void affects pending cases is to give it indirectly retrospective opera tion and that result is repugnant to the clear phraseology employed in the various articles in of the Con stitution.
REASONING,"The contention of the learned Attorney General that the phraseology employed in article 13 (1) of the Constitution clearly indicates that there was no intention to give any retrospective operation to the provisions of Part III of the Constitution and that the declaration that laws repugnant to Part III of the Constitution are void only operates from 26th January, 1950, has, in my opinion, force."
REASONING,"It seems clear that an existing statute in spite of a declaration by court that it is void remains in force till the 25th Janu ary, 1950, and continues to remain on the statute book even after the 26th January, 1950, except that no effect can be given to any of its provisions which are repugnant to the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution."
REASONING,The effect of article 13 (1)is only prospective and it operates in respect to the freedoms which are infringed by the State subsequent to the coming into force of the Constitution but the past acts of a person which came within the mischief of the law then in force are not affected 33 252 by Part III of the Constitution.
REASONING,"The reference made by Mr. Chari to different articles of the Constitution where saving clauses have been inserted to save pending proceedings or acts is not very helpful inasmuch as where a certain provi sion has a retrospective effect, then it is necessary to introduce a saving clause if things done in the past have to be saved from the retrospective effect of the statute; but where the provision is clearly not intended to be retrospec tive, then the necessity of saving clause does not arise."
REASONING,The provisions of the Constitution to which Mr. Chari made reference were of the nature that but for the saving clause the effect of them would be retrospective in character under the accepted canons of construction of statutes.
REASONING,Mr. Chari 's argument that it could not have been intend ed by the Constitution makers that prosecutions started under laws passed by a foreign power and which affect the freedoms guaranteed to the citizen under the Constitution in Part III were to be continued after the dawn of independence and after India had become a democratic republic to a cer tain extent seems to me to be plausible; but on further thought I have come to the conclusion that this argument appeals more to the heart than to the head and is not based on any sound principle of construction of statutes.
REASONING,"Under the accepted canons of construction of statutes, if a law has no retrospective operation of any kind whatsoever, then such a law cannot affect pending prosecutions or actions and the Constitution not being retrospective in its operation could not therefore in any way affect prosecutions started for offences that were complete under the law in force at the time they were committed."
REASONING,The cure for such an incon gruous state of affairs and the relief for such situation lies with the Government and the legislature and not with the courts.
REASONING,"If a case of sedition against an alien govern ment is continued after the coming into force of the Consti tution, the court cannot decline to proceed with it and to pass some sentence howsoever lenient, against an accused by placing a construction on the Constitution 253 which gives it retrospective operation, but the government of the republic or its legislature can always by executive or legislative action bring to a close all such distasteful proceedings and not only can it do so in the case of pending prosecutions but it can give relief also to persons who have suffered under laws of sedition against an alien government and are suffering terms of imprisonment in the jails of the Republic."
REASONING,"If punishment for contravention of such laws cannot be given to offenders because decision in their case has been delayed beyond the 26th January, 1950, it will be highly unreasonable not to give relief and to let punish ments continue in case of persons, the sentence against whom have already been passed under laws which were solely enact ed to maintain the alien rule."
REASONING,"Both cases, in my opinion, stand on the same footing and relief in those cases lies not with courts but with the executive government of the Repub lic."
REASONING,"If Mr. Chari 's argument that on the commencement of the Constitution on 26th January, 1950, all proceedings started under laws that became repugnant and inconsistent with the Constitution were to be stopped was accepted, it would lead to very strange results, and Mr. Chari had to concede that it would be so."
REASONING,"Suppose a person was convicted of the offence of sedition or of an offence under one of the safety Acts, the provisions of which are repugnant to the Constitution, but his appeal was pending in the High Court against his conviction, then, according to the conten tion of Mr. Chari, the court has no power to hear the appeal because the law being void, no further action could be taken in the matter."
REASONING,The result would be that the Court would not be able to hear an appeal and to give relief to the accused if he had been erroneously convicted.
REASONING,If a court cannot frame a charge or convict a person under a law that is repugnant to the Constitution equally it would not be enti tled to continue any proceeding for the benefit of the accused under cover of such a law.
REASONING,"Great deal of emphasis was laid during the course of the argument on the meaning to be given to the word ""void"" and it was said that this word in its widest 254 sense meant that the law declared void was void ab initio, i.e, from the very reception of the law it was bad."
REASONING,"H that meaning was given to this word, then it would mean that all laws existing on the 26th January, 1950, and which were declared void by article 13 (1) because of their being repugnant to the Constitution were bad when they were passed by the legislature, though at the same time the subject enjoyed no fundamental rights."
REASONING,"It was sought to give to this word ""void"" the same wide meaning as was given to the word ""repeal"" by Tindal C.J. in the case above mentioned."
REASONING,"With every respect to the great Judges who administered the common law in England during the earlier period of British history and in all humility I venture to say that the rule evolved by them qua ""repeal"" was of an artificial nature."
REASONING,The dictum of the learned Chief Justice that a repeal of a statute obliterates it completely from the records of Par liament as if it had never been passed is to my mind based on an extended meaning of that expression than its ordinary dictionary sense.
REASONING,"When a statute has been in operation, say for a period of fifty years, people have suffered penalties under it or have acquired rights thereunder and the law has been enforced by courts for such a long period, then to say that when it is repealed it is completely obliterated and that it never had any existence and was never passed by Parliament, is rather saying too much and is ignoring hard real facts and amounts to shutting one 's eyes to the actual ities of the situation."
REASONING,It would be more consonant with reason and justice to say that the law existed and was good at the time when it was passed but that since the date of its repeal it has no longer any effect whatsoever.
REASONING,The Parliament may however say in the repealing statute that it will have retrospective operation and it may also prescribe the limits of its retrospectivity and to that extent past transactions may be affected by it.
REASONING,"Because the rule of common law evolved by the English Judges was not in conso nance with reason and justice, a legislative practice was evolved under which each repealing statute contained a saving clause under 255 which past transactions were not allowed to be affected by the repeal."
REASONING,"Eventually the rule of common law was completely abrogated by the enactment of the Interpretation Act, 1889."
REASONING,"In India in the year 1868, section 6 of the enacted what was later on enacted in England in the Interpretation Act and for over eighty years it is this rule of construction that has been adopted in this country, the rule being that past transactions, whether closed or incho ate cannot be affected by the repeal of an earlier statute or by the coming into effect of a new one."
REASONING,"In my opinion, the rule contained in the and in the English Interpretation Act is more in consonance with reason and justice and is also a rule of convenience and should be followed in this country, in preference to the rule evolved by the English Judges in the earlier part of English legal history."
REASONING,"Be that as it may, it is unnecessary in this case to have resort either to the rule of common law or to the as the language of article 13 itself furnishes a solution to the problem."
REASONING,Reference was also made to the rule of construction applicable to temporary statutes.
REASONING,"In the case of such statutes, the rule of English law is that after the expiry of the life of the statute no action can be taken under the expired statute unless an intention can be gathered from its provisions to the contrary, but transactions already com pleted during the period that these statutes had the force of law are not in any way affected."
REASONING,That rule seems to be quite logical and is consonant with reason and justice.
REASONING,"When the life of a statute is limited and it dies a natural death, then no question either of its retrospective or of prospective nature arises."
REASONING,"If the intention of the statute was that anything done under it has to continue, then it will be allowed to continue; otherwise nothing done under it will be continued after its natural death."
REASONING,"Any rule applica ble to construction of such a statute has no application to the interpretation of the Constitution of India and the reference to this rule, in my opinion, is not relevant for the decision of this 256 Reference was also made to the rule of construction laid down by the American courts in respect of statutes de clared void because of their being repugnant to the Consti tution of the United States of America."
REASONING,"It is obvious that if a statute has been enacted and is repugnant to the Con stitution, the statute is void since its very birth and anything done under it is also void and illegal."
REASONING,The courts in America have followed the logical result of this rule and even convictions made under such an unconstitutional statute have been set aside by issuing appropriate writs.
REASONING,"If a statute is void from its very birth then anything done under it, whether closed, completed, or inchoate, will be wholly illegal and relief in one shape or another has to be given to the person affected by such an unconstitutional law."
REASONING,"This rule, however, is not applicable in regard to laws which were existing and were constitutional according to the Government of India Act, 1935."
REASONING,"Of course, if any law is made after the 25th January, 1950, which is repugnant to the Constitution, then the same rule will have to be followed by courts in India as is followed in America and even convic tions made under such an unconstitutional law will have to be set aside by resort to exercise of powers given to this court by the Constitution."
REASONING,The only rule of construction applicable to the inter pretation of article 13 of the Constitution is the one that concerns the determination of the question whether a statute is intended to have any retrospective operations.
REASONING,"If the well known canons of construction on this point are applied, then it has to be held that article 13 was not intended to have any retrospective effect whatever; on the other hand, its language denotes that it recognized the validity of the existing laws up to the date of the commencement of the Constitution and even after its commencement except to the extent of their repugnancy to any provisions of Part III of the Constitution."
REASONING,"On this construction of article 13 it cannot affect any past transactions, whether closed or inchoate."
REASONING,Reference in this connection may be made to the provisions of 257 article 372(2) of the Constitution.
REASONING,"Under this article the President has been given power to adapt existing laws and to bring them in accordance with the articles of the Constitu tion by a process of amendment, repeal or adaptation."
REASONING,"The President could have repealed the Press (Emergency Powers) Act and brought the law in accordance with the provisions of Part III of the Constitution and if he had used the powers of repeal given to him by this article, the provisions of the would have been immediately attract ed to that situation and the pending prosecution of the appellant would have to be continued in view of those provi sions."
REASONING,"If in that situation the Constitution contemplates the continuance of pending proceedings under existing laws, it becomes difficult to place a different interpretation on the phraseology employed in article 13(1) of the Constitu tion, than the one that is in accord with that situation."
REASONING,By the construction that I have placed on this article that incongruous result is avoided.
REASONING,"In view of the decision above arrived at it seems unnec essary to pronounce on the alternative argument of the learned Attorney General to the effect that the expression ' 'void ', used in article 13 of the Constitution is synonymous with the word ""repeal"" and that it was an apt word used in the context to indicate the same intention."
REASONING,"It was said that the word ""repeal"" was not used in the article but instead the expression ""void"" was employed therein by the draftsmen in order to include within its ambit cases of custom and usage where such custom and usage were also repugnant to the provisions of Part III of the Constitution."
REASONING,It was also urged that by article 13 (1)the Constitution in express terms repealed all laws inconsistent with its provi sions and that the only power given to the court was to find out which of these laws was inconsistent with the provisions of Part III.
REASONING,The declaration that these laws were void or repealed was by the force of the provisions of article 13 itself and did not result from the decision of the courts.
REASONING,"It is also unnecessary to examine the further argument of the learned 258 Attorney General that in any case since 1868 in this country the rule of construction of statutes is the one laid down by section 6 of the General Clauses Act,1868, and that though in express terms that statute may not be applicable to the construction of article 13(1) of the Constitution, yet that rule is a rule of justice, equity and good conscience and has become a rule of common law in this country and should be applied even to cases where statutes become void by rea son of their being repugnant to the Constitution."
RPC,For the reasons given above I see no force in this appeal and I would accordingly dismiss it.
RPC,MUKHERJEA J. I am in entire agreement with the view taken by my learned brother Fazl Ali J. in his judgment and I concur both in his reasons and his conclusion.
RPC,Appeal dismissed.

COUNSEL,"M.C. Setalvad, Attorney General for India (G. N. Joshi, with him) for the respondent."
JUDGE,The judgment of the Court was deliv ered by MAHAJAN J.
FACTS,Bombay modifying the decree of the trial court and decreeing partially the plaintiff 's suit.
FACTS,The appellants are the legal representatives of the original plaintiff Haji Ali Mohamed Haji Cassum.
FACTS,The State of Bombay is the respondent.
FACTS,"The facts giving rise to this Controversy, briefly stated, are as follows ; 35 268 Village Dahisar originally formed part of the Malad Estate comprising in all eight villages."
FACTS,"The said estate was conveyed by the East India Company to two Dady brothers for valuable consideration by a deed of indenture dated the 25th January, 1819."
FACTS,"By that conveyance all the lands in the eight villages were conveyed absolutely to the said purchas ers and it was covenanted by the Company that the purchas ers, their heirs and assigns shall peaceably and quietly enjoy the said villages and receive and take the rents and profits thereof without any hindrance or interruption from the said Company."
FACTS,"By a sale deed dated the 13th December, 1900, Haji Cassum, father of the plaintiff, purchased the village of Dahisar from its proprietors for a price of Rs. 1,30,000 and after his death the plaintiff became the pro prietor thereof and as such received rents and assessment from the tenants and holders of the lands in the village according to the rights prevailing under the survey settle ment which had taken place in the village about the year 1864 65."
FACTS,In the year 1879 the Bombay Land Revenue Code was enact ed.
STATUTE,"Section 48 of the Code is in these terms : ""48."
STATUTE,"(1) The land revenue leviable on any land under the provisions of this Act shall be assessed, or shall be deemed to have been assessed, as the case may be, with reference to the use of the land (a) for the purpose of agriculture, (b) for the purpose of building, and (c) for a purpose other than agriculture or building."
STATUTE,"(2) Where land assessed for use for any purpose is used for any other purpose, the assessment fixed under the provi sions of this Act upon such land shall, notwithstanding that the term for which such assessment may have been fixed has not expired, be liable to be altered and fixed at a differ ent rate by such authority and subject to such rules as the Provincial Government may prescribe in this behalf . . . "" 269 After the Act came into force, the Government drafted rules under the provisions of section 214 for promulgation."
FACTS,The inamdars represented to the Government that the rules should be so framed as not to prejudice their rights under the conveyances executed by the Company in their favour.
FACTS,"The draft rules were promulgated by a notification issued on the 5th June, 1907."
REASONING,"On that date, the Government adopted a resolution ordering that the rules be promulgated and also giving an assurance to the inamdars to the following effect : ""Government will, however, be prepared to amend or abrogate these rules if they are found to be detrimental in any material respects to the interests of the inamdars."
REASONING,""" Rule 92 is one of the rules promulgated under the provisions of the Act and it runs thus : ""When land assessed for purposes of agriculture only is subsequently used for any purpose unconnected with agricul ture the assessment upon the land so used shall, unless otherwise directed by Government, be altered under sub section (2) of section 48 by the collector in accordance with rules 81 to 87 inclusive."" On the 25th July, 1923, the plaintiff requested the Commissioner of Bombay, Suburban District, for a revision of the survey of Dahisar village."
REASONING,He executed an agreement under the provisions of section 216 of the Bombay Land Revenue Code and made a formal application in that behalf as required by the Code and the rules made thereunder.
REASONING,"The Commissioner by his letter dated the 14th March, 1925, authorised the extension of the provisions of chapters 8 and 9 of the Land Revenue Code to the village in question."
REASONING,The plaintiff also deposited the necessary expenses required for the revision of the survey.
REASONING,"The revision was made by the Superintendent of the Land Records who submitted his report to the Commissioner on the 15th December, 1926."
REASONING,This report was sanctioned by Government.
REASONING,"The order sanctioning the revised survey was communicated to the plaintiff on the 23rd 270 December, 1927."
REASONING,"Under the revised survey the assessment of Rs. 4,217 on the village lands was increased to Rs. 6,057 3 2, and the plaintiff from that date started recover ing the increased assessment from the tenants of the lands in the village."
REASONING,At the time of the revision of the survey it was found that nine plots of land comprised in eleven field numbers which were formerly agricultural had been built upon and these were being used for non agricultural purposes.
REASONING,"The survey officer formed them into a separate group and showed them as kharaba and no assessment, either agricultural or non agricultural, was levied on these nine plots and the plaintiff could not therefore recover any assessment in respect of these plots after 1926."
REASONING,"On the BOth April, 1934, he requested the Collector to assess non agricultural assessment on these plots."
REASONING,"This request was refused by the Collector on the 17th July, 1935, in these terms: ""With reference to your letter dated 30 4 1934, I have the honour to state that I regret your request cannot be granted."
REASONING,""" It has to be observed that this refusal was in contra vention of the provisions of rule 92 which imposes on the Collector a duty to make alteration in the assessment, unless he has been directed to the contrary by Government."
REASONING,"It was not denied that by the 17th July, 1935, no such direction had been given to the Collector by Government."
REASONING,"If the Collector had done his duty as enjoined by rule 92, this lengthy and unnecessary litigation might well have been avoided."
REASONING,Against the order of the Collector the plaintiff ap pealed to the Commissioner.
REASONING,In his appeal he pointed out that certain additional lands in the village had been con verted to non agricultural uses subsequent to the revision of the survey in 1926.
REASONING,The Commissioner declined to inter fere.
REASONING,"This information was conveyed by the Collector to the counsel for the plaintiff on the 22nd May, 1937."
REASONING,"Against the Commissioner 's decision, the plaintiff appealed to the Governor in Council and 271 on the 20th December, 1937, he received a copy of the fol lowing communication from Government to the Commissioner : ""The undersigned presents compliments to the Commis sioner, Northern Division, and with reference to his letter, No. L.N.D. 3124, dated 20th April, 1936, on the subject noted above, is directed to invite his attention, to the orders issued in Government Resolution, No. s235/3a, dated 8th March, 1937, and to state that Government confirm the action of the Collector, Bombay Suburban District, in refusing the Khot 's request for the levy of nonagricultural assessment in the village of Dahisar."
REASONING,"By order of the Governor in Council, for Under Secretary to the Government of Bombay."
REASONING,""" In order to find out whether there was any resolution of the Government as mentioned in the above communication, during the pendency of the suit the plaintiff issued the following interrogatory to the Government of the State of Bombay : ""When was the decision, not to assess the lands men tioned in Schedule II of the plaint and other lands under rule 92, referred to in para."
REASONING,8 of their written statement arrived at by the Government ? Produce a copy of the said decision which may have been embodied in a Government resolution along with the opinion of the Government officers with which Government may have concurred.
REASONING,""" The answer given on behalf of the State Government to this question was as follows : ""(8) Government Memorandum, Revenue Department, No. 5235 B/33, dated the 8th March, 1937, confirmed the Collec tor 's action in refusing the proprietor 's request for the levy of non agricultural assessment. ' ' This answer indicates that the Government acting under rule 92, neither adopted any resolution nor issued any notification giving any directions to the Collector contrary to the provisions contained in that 272 rule."
REASONING,All that it did was to confirm the Collector 's order rejecting the request of the plaintiff for making the as sessment of non agricultural lands in the village.
REASONING,During the interval between 1927 37 a large number of plots of land mentioned in schedule II were put to non agricultural uses by the tenants in possession of them and a number of buildings were constructed thereupon.
REASONING,"The plain tiff having failed in persuading the Government to make an assessment under rule 92 of such lands, after service of notice under section 80 of the Code of Civil Procedure, instituted the present suit, (a) for a declaration that he was entitled to have nonagricultural assessment made on all lands in the village of Dahisar which were used or which may thereafter be brought into use for purposes other than agricultural, and (b)for an order that the Collector of Bombay, Suburban District, be directed to determine the amount of non agricultural assessment on the lands mentioned in schedules I and II of the plaint and to levy the same under clause 2 of rule 96 and pay it to the plaintiff, or in the alternative, to direct the defendant to issue a commission to the plaintiff under section 88 of the Land Revenue Code."
REASONING,"Schedule I gave details of the nine plots of land that had been converted into non agricultural use before the survey of 1926, while schedule II gave details of those lands which since 1926 up to the date of the suit had been converted to such use."
REASONING,The plaintiff also claimed damages to the extent of Rs. 120 as compensation for loss of agricultural assessment for six years in respect of lands mentioned in schedule I and he claimed similar damages to the extent of Rs. 300 for loss of non agricultural assess ment in respect of the other lands.
REASONING,He also claimed future damages and costs.
REASONING,The suit was resisted by the State Government on a number of grounds.
REASONING,It was contended that it was barred under section 4 (c) of the Revenue Jurisdiction Act and under article 14 of the Indian Limitation Act.
REASONING,On the merits it was pleaded that the action of the survey officer and the Collector in refusing to levy non agricultural assessment on lands contained in the 273 two schedules was lawful and proper and that the civil court could not question the discretion of the Government in such matters.
RLC,The trial Judge negatived all the technical objections raised by the defendant and on the merits held that the Collector 's action in refusing to levy nonagricultural assessment on the lands in question was wrongful.
REASONING,"He, there fore, granted the declaration prayed for."
REASONING,"He, however, refused to give further relief to the plaintiff and disal lowed the prayer for a direction for levying non agricultur al assessment on the lands given in the two schedules and for paying it to the plaintiff."
REASONING,He observed that the Govern ment would be well advised if it levied such assessment and paid it to the plaintiff.
REASONING,Two appeals were taken to the High Court against the decree of the trial Judge.
REASONING,That Court modified this decree and granted a declaration to the plaintiff that he was entitled to receive non agricultural assessment on all lands which are and which may hereafter be used for non agricul tural purposes.
REASONING,It ordered the defendant to levy such altered assessment on the lands mentioned in schedule I and decreed consequential damages to the plaintiff in respect to these lands.
REASONING,"As regards the lands in schedule II, the plain tiff 's suit for a direction to assess and levy non agricul tural assessment on them was dismissed."
REASONING,The court drew a distinction between lands that had been converted to non agricultural use before the survey of 1926 and those which had since then been converted to such use.
REASONING,"As regards the former, it was held that the survey officer had erroneously declined to make non agricultural assessment on those lands and his action was ultra vires."
REASONING,Relief was given to the plaintiff regarding those lands as prayed for.
REASONING,"As regards the latter, it was held that it was within the discretion of the Government to order an alteration of the assessment on such lands and this discretion could not be questioned in a court of law."
REASONING,The plaintiff being dissatisfied with this part of the decision made an application for leave to appeal to.
REASONING,"the Privy Council on the 15th 274 September, 1945."
REASONING,During the pendency of the application the plaintiff died and his heirs and executors were implead ed as his legal representatives.
REASONING,"A certificate for leave to appeal to the Privy Council was granted on the th February, 1947, and the appeal preferred under the certificate is now before us for decision."
REASONING,There is no controversy in this appeal as regards the reliefs that have been given to the plaintiff by the High Court.
REASONING,The appeal concerns the fur ther relief refused to the plaintiff in respect to the lands mentioned in schedule II.
REASONING,"It was contended on behalf of the appellant that under the terms of the conveyance dated 25th January, 1819, and of the covenants contained therein it was not open to the Government or the Collector to refuse the alteration of the assessment claimed by the plaintiff and that the Government could not give any direction under rule 92 which would be contrary to these covenants and assur ances."
REASONING,It was said that the Government was bound to use its power to levy assessment as trustee for the transferee and that the exercise of this power could not be arbitrarily refused by it.
REASONING,"It was urged that the Government Resolution dated 5th June, 1907, clearly indicated that the rules framed under the Land Revenue Code were not intended to affect adversely the owners of alienated lands and the Collector was bound to make an assessment as required by the plaintiff."
REASONING,"Lastly, it was argued that as a matter of fact Government never exercised its power under rule 92 and never gave a direction to the Collector to a contrary effect and that the mere affirmation of the erroneous order of the Collector by Government did not amount to a direction con templated by the provisions of rule 92."
REASONING,"Having considered this case in all its aspects, we have reached the decision that the High Court 's decision have in so far as it refused relief to the plaintiff in respect to the lands mentioned in schedule II should be reversed."
REASONING,Rule 92 cited in the earlier part of this judgment in imper ative terms directs the Collector to alter the assessment in case agricultural lands are Converted to non agricultural use.
REASONING,The Collector has 275 no option in the matter and as soon as an application is made to him he should proceed to make an assessment and levy it on the non agricultural lands.
REASONING,"When the Collector de clined to accede to the request of the plaintiff he acted in contravention of the clear provisions of the rule, because admittedly at that time no ""directions to the contrary"" had been given to him by the Government."
REASONING,There was no resolu tion of the Government in existence and no notification had been issued under the provisions of rule 92 directing the Collector not to make an alteration in the assessment when required to do so.
REASONING,"The Commissioner, in dismissing the plaintiff 's appeal, also contravened the provisions of rule 92."
REASONING,"When the matter went up in appeal to the Governor in Council, no decision was taken under the provisions of rule 92."
RLC,The High Court assumed that the confirmation of the action of the Collector by the Government amounted to a direction by the Government to the contrary in respect of the lands in question.
REASONING,We are unable to agree with this conclusion.
REASONING,"When Gov ernment has been given the power to give directions to the Collector not to act in accordance with the imperative provisions of a rule which enjoin upon him to make the altered assessment, that power has to be exercised in clear and unambiguous terms as it affects civil rights of the persons concerned and the decision that the power has been exercised should be notified in the usual manner in which such decisions are made known to the public."
REASONING,It was conceded by Mr. Joshi that no such decision was taken by Government and no direction was issued by Government under rule 92 Dismissal by the Government of the plaintiff 's appeal and affirmation by it of an erroneous order of the Collector could not be held to amount to action under the provisions of rule 92.
REASONING,"In these circumstances, the plaintiff was clearly entitled to further relief in respect to lands mentioned in schedule II and a direction should have been issued to the State Government for making altered assessment on non agricultural lands and levy it on them and pay it to the plaintiff."
REASONING,"36 276 Mr. Joshi contended that the true effect of the provi sions contained in section 48 (2) and rule 92 was that the Government was not bound to levy altered assessment on lands converted to non agricultural use, that the section merely provided that the persons in possession of land were liable for such assessment but it did not say that it was obligato ry on the Government to make it and that the court had no jurisdiction to interfere with the discretion of the Govern ment in the matter."
REASONING,"We think that when a liability is imposed by a statute, that liability cannot be defeated by the exercise of any discretion by Government or by making rules which may negative that liability, but it is not necessary in this case to finally decide the point as the appeal stands decided otherwise."
REASONING,It is also unnecessary to express an opinion as to the precise scope of the power conferred on Government by the language of rule 92.
REASONING,The plaintiff 's learned counsel very properly did not press his appeal in respect to the claim of damages concern ing lands mentioned in schedule II.
RPC,Plaintiff 's suit to that extent fails.
RPC,For the reasons given above the appeal is allowed and the plaintiff 's suit is decreed with costs except in regard to the claim for damages in respect to the lands mentioned in schedule II.
RPC,The defendant is directed to make an assess ment on lands mentioned in schedule II in the same way as in respect of the lands mentioned in schedule I and levy the same and pay it to the plaintiff.
RPC,Appeal allowed.

JUDGE,The judgment of the Court was deliv ered by FAZL ALL J.
FACTS,This is an appeal from a judgment and decree of the High Court of Judicature at Patna reversing the appellate decree of a Subordinate Judge in a suit insti tuted by the respondents.
FACTS,The respondents have been in occupation as a monthly tenant of several blocks of premises belonging to the appellants at a monthly rental of Rs. 112.
FACTS,"The rent for the months of March, April and May, 1942, having fallen into arrears, they remitted it along with the rent for June, on 28th June, 1947, by means of two cheques."
FACTS,"As the appellants did not accept the cheques, on 4th August, 1947, the re spondents remitted the amount subsequently by postal money order."
FACTS,"On 12th August, 1947, the appellants, maintaining that there was non payment of rent and hence the respond ents were liable to be evicted, under section 1 1 (1) (a) of the Bihar Buildings (Lease, Rent and Eviction) Control Act, 1947 (Bihar Act III of 1947), applied to the House Control ler for the eviction of the respondents from the premises."
FACTS,"Section 11 (1) (a) of the Act runs as follows : ""Notwithstanding anything contained in any agreement or law to the contrary and subject to the provisions of section 12, where a tenant is in possession of any building, he shall not be liable to be evicted therefrom, whether in execution of a decree or otherwise, except 147 (a) in the case of a month to month tenant, for non payment of rent or breach of the conditions of the tenancy, or for subletting the building or any portion thereof with out the consent of the landlord, or if he is an employee of the landlord occupying the building as an employee, on his ceasing to be in such employment ;"" On 30th August, 1947, the respondents, whose money order had in the meantime been returned by the appellants, deposited the rent up to the month of June in the Office of the House Controller."
FACTS,"Notwithstanding this deposit, the House Controller passed an order on the both November, directing the eviction of the respondents by 10th May, 1948, and holding that they had made themselves liable to eviction by reason ' of non payment of rent."
FACTS,"The order of the House Controller was upheld by the Commissioner on appeal on the 27th April, 1948, and thereupon the respondents filed the present suit in the Patna Munsif 's Court for a declaration that the order of the ContrOller dated the 10th November, 1947, was illegal, ultra vires and without jurisdiction."
FACTS,"The suit was dismissed by the Munsif and his decree was upheld on appeal, but the 'High Court decreed the suit holding that the order of the Rent Controller was without jurisdiction."
FACTS,"The appellants were thereafter granted leave to appeal by the High Court, and they have accordingly preferred this appeal."
RLC,"The High Court has delivered a somewhat elaborate judg ment in the case, but it seems to us that the point ' aris ing in this appeal is a simple one."
REASONING,"The main ground on which the respondents have attacked the order of eviction passed by the House Controller is that in fact there was no non payment of rent, and, since no eviction can be ordered under the Bihar Act unless non payment is established, the House 'Controller had no jurisdiction to order eviction."
REASONING,"On the other hand, one of the contentions put forward on behalf of the appellants is that there was non payment of rent within the meaning of that expression as used in the Act, since the rent was not paid as and when it 148 fell due."
REASONING,"It was pointed out that the rent for the month of March became due in April and the rent for April became due in May, but no step was taken by the respondents to pay the arrears until the 28th June, 1947."
REASONING,"It appears that at the inception of the tenancy, the respondents had paid one month 's rent in advance, and it had been agreed between them and the appellants that the advance rent would be adjusted whenever there was default in payment of rent for full one month."
REASONING,"It was however pointed out that the advance payment could be adjusted only for one month 's rent, but, in the present case, the rent for three months had become due, and, since in a monthly tenancy the rent is payable for month to month, the rent for each month becoming due in the subse quent month, non payment of that rent at the proper time was sufficient to attract the provisions of section 11(1) (a) of the Act."
REASONING,"The appellants also raised a second contention, namely, that having regard to the scheme of the Act, the House Controller was fully competent to decide whether the condition precedent to eviction had been satisfied, anal once that decision had been arrived at, it could not be questioned in a civil court."
REASONING,"This contention was accepted by the first two courts, and the first appellate court dealing with it observed as follows : ""But the Buildings Control Act has authorised the Con troller to decide whether or not there is nonpayment of rent and it is only when he is satisfied that there has been nonpayment of rent that he assumes jurisdiction."
REASONING,"If the question of jurisdiction depends upon the decision of some fact or point of law, and if the court is called upon to decide such question, then such decision cannot be collater ally impeached (vide 12 Patna 117)."
REASONING,In my opinion when the Controller assumed the jurisdiction on being satisfied that there was non payment of rent and proceeded to pass an order of eviction.
RLC,I think the Civil Court can have no jurisdic tion to challenge the validity of such order.
RLC,""" The High Court did not however accept this view, and after referring to section 111 of the Transfer of 149 Property Act, proceeded to propound its own view in these words: ""Regard being had to the circumstances in which the Act under consideration was enacted and its object, as stated in the preamble as being 'to prevent unreasonable eviction of tenants ' from buildings, it would seem that the expres sion 'non payment of rent ' in section 11 in the context in which it is used must be given an interpretation which would have the effect of enlarging the protection against determi nation of a tenancy enjoyed by a tenant under the ordinary law."
REASONING,"The Legislature, therefore, by enacting that a tenant shall not be liable to be evicted 'except for nonpayment of rent ' should be held to have intended to protect a tenant from being evicted from a building in his possession for being a defaulter in payment of rent, if he brings into Court all the rent due from him before the order of his eviction comes to be passed ."
REASONING,"If, as contended for on behalf of the respondents, section 11 of the Act were to be construed as entitling a landlord to apply for eviction of a tenant on the ground of irregular payment of rent amounting to ' non payment ' of rent and as empowering the Controller to determine as to whether irregular payment of rent amounts to non payment of rent within the meaning of sub section (1)of section 11, and subsection (3) of section 18 were to be construed as making the decision of the Controller on this question of law a final one, it will appear that not only this Act will have conferred a right upon the landlord very much in excess of the right that he enjoys under the ordinary law in the matter of determination of tenancies, but that it will have conferred very much larger power on the Controller than that possessed by the Civil Courts under the ordinary law in the matter of passing decrees for eviction of tenants."
REASONING,"The principle of law and equity on which relief against forfei ture for ',non payment of rent ' is based, will have been completely abrogated, and the protection of a tenant in possession of a building instead of being enlarged will 150 have been very much curtailed."
REASONING,"A construction of these provisions, which is calculated to bring about these conse quences, cannot and is not in accordance with the circum stances to which this Act was intended to apply and indeed cannot be accepted."
REASONING,"The contention of Mr. Lalnarain Sinha on behalf of the respondent that the circumstances disclosed in the petition raised the question for determination by the Controller whether a case of non payment of rent in law was established, and his decision of that question, even if wrong in law, is not liable to be questioned in the Civil Court must be over ruled."
REASONING,""" It seems to us that the view taken by the High Court is not correct."
STATUTE,"Section 11 begins with the words ""Notwithstand ing anything contained in any agreement or law to the con trary,"" and hence any attempt to import the provisions relating to the law of transfer of property for the inter pretation of the section would seem to be out of place."
STATUTE,"Section 11 is a self contained section, and it is wholly unnecessary to go outside the Act for determining whether a tenant is liable to be evicted or not, and under what condi tions he can be evicted."
REASONING,"It clearly provides that a tenant is not liable to be evicted except on certain conditions, and one of the conditions laid down for the eviction of a month to month tenant is non payment of rent."
STATUTE,"Sub section (8) (b) of section 11 provides that the ""Controller shall, if he is satisfied that the claim of the landlord is bona fide, make an order directing the tenant to put the landlord in possession of the building"" and if he is not so satisfied he shall make an order rejecting the application."
STATUTE,Section 16 empowers the Controller to make enquiries and inspections and to summon and enforce the attendance of witnesses and compel the production of documents in the same manner as is provided in the Code of Civil Procedure.
STATUTE,"Section 18 pro vides that any person aggrieved by an order passed by the Controller may within 15 days of the receipt of such order by him, prefer an appeal to the Commissioner of the Divi sion, and it also prescribes the procedure for the hearing of the appeal."
STATUTE,"Sub section (3) 151 of this section states that ""the decision of the Commission er and subject only to such decision, an order of the Con troller shall be final, and shall not be liable to be ques tioned in any Court of law whether in a suit or other pro ceeding by way of appeal or revision."
REASONING,""" The Act thus sets up a complete machinery for the investigation of those matters upon which the jurisdiction of the Controller to order eviction of a tenant depends, and it expressly makes his order final and subject only to the decision of the Commis sioner."
REASONING,"The Act empowers the Controller alone to decide whether or not there is non payment of rent, and his deci sion on that question is essential before an order can be passed by him under section 11."
REASONING,Such being the provisions of the Act we have to see whether it is at all possible to question the decision of the Controller on a matter which the Act clearly empowers him to decide.
REASONING,"The law on this subject has been very lucidly stated by Lord Esher M.R. in The Queen vs Commissioners for Special Purposes of the Income Tax(1), in these words : ""When an inferior court or tribunal or body, which has to exercise the power of deciding facts, is first estab lished by Act of Parliament, the legislature has to consider what powers it will give that tribunal or body."
REASONING,"It may in effect say that, if a certain state of facts exists and is shown to such tribunal or body before it proceeds to do certain things, it shall have jurisdiction to do such things, but not otherwise."
REASONING,"There it is not for them conclu sively to decide whether that state of facts exists, and, if they exercise the jurisdiction without its existence, what they do may be questioned, and it will be held that they have acted without jurisdiction."
REASONING,But there is another state of things which may exist.
REASONING,"The legislature may intrust the tribunal or body with a jurisdiction, which includes the jurisdiction to determine whether the preliminary state of facts exists as well as the jurisdiction, on finding that it does exist, to proceed further or do (1) , at .319."
REASONING,"When the legislature are establishing such a tribunal or body with limited jurisdiction, they also have to consider, whatever jurisdiction they give them, whether there shall be any appeal from their decision, for otherwise there will be none."
REASONING,"In the second of the two cases I have mentioned it is an erroneous application of the formula to say that the tribunal cannot give themselves jurisdiction by wrongly deciding certain facts to exist, because the legis lature gave them jurisdiction to determine all the facts, including the existence of the preliminary facts on which the further exercise of their jurisdiction depends; and if they were given jurisdiction so to decide without any appeal being given, there is no appeal from such exercise of their jurisdiction."
REASONING,""" On the same lines are the following observations of Sir James Colville in The Colonial Bank of Australasia vs Wil lan(1), which is a case dealing with the principles on which a writ of certiorari may be issued : ""Accordingly, the authorities. establish that an adju dication by a Judge having jurisdiction over the subject matter is, if no defect appears on the face of it, to be taken as conclusive of the facts stated therein; and that the Court of Queen 's Bench will not on certiorari quash such an adjudication on the ground that any such fact, however essential, has been erroneously found."
REASONING,""" There can be no doubt that the present case falls within the second category mentioned by Lord Esher, because here the Act has entrusted the Controller with a jurisdiction, which includes the jurisdiction to determine whether there is non payment of rent or not, as well as the jurisdiction, on finding that there is nonpayment of rent, to order evic tion of a tenant."
REASONING,"Therefore, even if the Controller may be assumed to have wrongly decided the question of non payment of rent, which by no means is clear, his order cannot be questioned in a civil court."
RPC,"It seems to us that on this short ground this appeal must succeed, and we (1) , at p. 443."
RPC,"153 accordingly allow the appeal, set aside the judgment and decree of the High Court and restore the decree of the courts below."
RPC,The appellants will be entitled to costs throughout.

COUNSEL,"N.C. Chatterjee (B. Sen, with him), for the appellants."
COUNSEL,"A.N. Grover, for the respondents."
JUDGE,The judgment of Fazl Ali and Patanja li Sastri JJ. was delivered by FAZL ALI J.
FACTS,"On the 25th January, 1946, the appellants entered into a contract with the respondents for the sale of 5,000 mounds of jute, which was evidenced by a ""sold note"" (Exhibit A), which is in the form of a letter addressed to the respond ents, commencing with these words: ""We have this day sold by your order and for your account to the undersigned, etc."
FACTS,""" The word ""undersigned"" admittedly refers to the appellants, and, at the end of the contract, below their signature, the word ""brokers"" is written."
FACTS,"On the same day, a ""bought note"" (Exhibit B) was addressed by the appellants to the Bengal Jute Mill Company, with the following statement: ""We have this day bought by your order and."
FACTS,"for your account from the undersigned, 794 etc."
FACTS,""" In this note also, the word ""undersigned"" refers to the appellants and underneath their signature, the word ""brokers"" appears, as in the ""sold note"" There are various provisions in the sold note, relating to delivery of jute, non delivery of documents, nonacceptance of documents, claims, etc., but the most material provisions are to be found in paragraphs 10 and 11."
FACTS,"paragraph 10 provides that the sellers may in certain cases be granted an extension of time for delivering the jute for a period not exceeding thirty days from the due date free of all penalties, and if the contract is not implemented within the extended peri od, the buyers would be entitled to several options, one of them being to cancel the contract and charge the sellers the difference between the contract rate and the market rate on the day on which the option is declared."
FACTS,"In the same para graph, there is another provision to the following effect: ""Sellers shall notify Buyers that goods will or will not be shipped within such extended period referred to in (a) and in the case of sellers intimating that they will be unable to ship within the extended time Buyers shall exercise their option within 5 working days of receiving notice and notify Sellers."
FACTS,In the absence of any such notice from Sellers it shall be deemed that the goods have not been shipped and Buyers shall exercise their option within 5 working days after expiration of extended date and notify Sellers.
FACTS,""" The 11th paragraph provides among other things that ""all matters, questions, disputes, differences and/or claims arising out of and/or concerning and/or in connection and/or in consequence of or relating to this Contract whether or not obligations of either or both parties under this contract be subsisting at the time of such disputes and whether or not this contract has been terminated or purport ed to be terminated or completed shall be referred to the arbitration of the Bengal Chamber of Commerce under the rules of its Tribunal of Arbitration for the time being in force and according to such rules the arbitration shall be conducted."
FACTS,""" 795 It is common ground that the respondents delivered 2,256 maunds of jute under the contract, but the balance of 2,744 maunds could not be delivered within the stipulated period, and, by mutual agreement, time was extended up to the 30th June, 1946."
FACTS,"On the 2nd July, 1946, the respondents addressed a letter to the appellants stating that the balance of jute could not be despatched owing to lack of wagons, and ""exten sion"" was requested for a period of one month."
FACTS,"In reply to this letter, which was received by the appellants on or about the 3rd July, 1946, time was extended till the 31st July, 1946."
FACTS,"On the same day on which the reply was received by the respondents, i.e., on the 9th July, 1946, they ad dressed a letter to the appellants pointing out that the extension of time had not been intimated within the 5th working day as provided in the contract and therefore the contract was automatically cancelled."
FACTS,"After this letter, some further correspondence followed between the two par ties, and finally a bill of difference amounting to Rs. 4,116 was submitted by the appellants to the respondents, who, in their turn, denied their liability to pay the sum."
FACTS,The appellants thereupon claimed arbitration under clause 11 of the sold note and submitted the dispute between them and the respondents to the Bengal Chamber of Commerce.
FACTS,"On the 6th February, 1947, the Tribunal of Arbitration made an award to the effect that the due date of contract had been extended by mutual agreement up to the 31st July, 1946, and accordingly the respondents should pay to the appellants a sum of Rs. 4,116 together with interest at the rate of 4% per annum from the 10th August, 1946, until the date of the award."
FACTS,A sum of Rs. 210 was also held to be payable by the respondents on account of costs.
FACTS,"Nearly a year later, on the 19th February, 1949, a petition was presented by the re spondents under the Indian , to the High Court at Calcutta, in its ordinary original civil jurisdiction, praying inter alia that the award may be adjudged to be without jurisdiction and void and not binding on the respondents, and that it may be set aside."
FACTS,"The main point raised by the 796 respondents in the petition was that it was not open to the appellants to invoke the arbitration clause, as the Bengal Jute Mill Company and not the appellants were the real party to the contract and the appellants had acted as mere bro kers."
FACTS,"The appellants asserted in reply that the allegation made by the respondents in regard to there being no privity between them and the appellants was wrong, and in paragraph 16 of their affidavit they stated as follows : ""With regard to paragraph 7 of the petition I crave reference to the said contract for its true construction and effect."
REASONING,I say as I have already stated that according to the custom or usage or practice of the trade the respondent is entitled to charge brokerage and also to enforce the terms of the said contract.
REASONING,""" The case was heard by Sinha J., who dismissed the peti tion on the ground that the contract was directly between the respondents and the appellants."
REASONING,The learned Judge also observed that if the right of the appellants to enforce the contract depended upon the existence of custom it would have been necessary to take evidence and the arbitrators would have had jurisdiction to decide the question of the exist ence of custom.
REASONING,"The respondents being dissatisfied with the judgment of Sinha J., preferred an appeal, which was heard and disposed of by a Division Bench of the High Court consisting of the learned Chief Justice and Chakravarthi J."
REASONING,"The learned Judges held that having regard to the fact that the appellants ' own contention was that they had entered into the contract as brokers and were entitled to enforce its terms by reason of the usage or custom of the trade, it was not open to Sinha J. to treat them as principals, and the award was liable to be set aside on the ground that the arbitration tribunal had no jurisdiction to make an award at the instance of a per son who was not a principal party to the contract."
REASONING,"The appellants thereafter having obtained a certificate from the High Court under section 109 (c) of the Code of Civil Proce dure, preferred this appeal."
REASONING,797 It seems to us that this appeal can be disposed of on a short ground.
REASONING,"We have carefully read the affidavit filed on behalf of the appellants in the trial court, and we are unable to hold that their case was that they were not par ties to the contract or that they had asked the court to proceed on the sole ground that they were entitled to en force the contract by virtue of the custom or usage of the trade."
REASONING,"In our opinion, the position which was taken up by them may be summed up as follows : (1) They did not accept the allegations made by the respond ents that they were not parties to any arbitration agreement with the respondents."
REASONING,(2) They asked the Court to construe the contract and its effect and asserted that they were entitled to enforce it.
REASONING,(3) They also stated that they were entitled to enforce the contract according to the custom or usage of the trade.
REASONING,The principal dispute raised in this case was whether the extension of time for delivery was granted within the time limited in the contract.
REASONING,That dispute is certainly covered by the arbitration clause.
REASONING,The further dispute that the brokers (appellants) were not parties to the contract in their own right as principals but entered into the contract only on behalf of the Bengal Jute Mill Company does not appear to have been raised until the matter went to the arbitrators.
REASONING,"Assuming that at that stage it was open to the respondents to raise such an objection, after the other dispute which clearly fell within the arbitration clause was referred to the arbitrators, this further dispute is also one which turns upon the true interpretation of the con tract, so that the respondents must have recourse to the contract to establish their claim that the appellants were not bound as principals while the latter say that they were: If that is the position, such a dispute, the determination of which turns on the true construction of the contract, would also seem to be a dispute, under or arising out of or concerning the contract."
REASONING,"In a 798 passage quoted in Heyman vs Darwins Ltd.(1), Lord Dunedin propounds the test thus: "" If a party has to have recourse to the contract, that dispute is a dispute under the con tract ""."
REASONING,"Here, the respondents must have recourse to the contract to establish their case and therefore it is a dispute falling within the arbitration clause."
REASONING,The error into which the learned Judges of the appellate Bench of the High Court appear to have fallen was their regarding the dispute raised by the respondent in respect of the position of the appellants under the contract as having the same consequence as a dispute as to the contract ever having been entered into.
REASONING,"If, therefore, we come to the conclusion that both the disputes raised by the respondents fail within the scope of the arbitration clause, then there is an end of the matter, for the arbitrators would have jurisdiction to adjudicate on the disputes, and we are not concerned with any error of law or fact committed by them or any omission on their part to consider any of the matters."
REASONING,"In this view, it would not be for us to determine the true construction of the contract and find out whether the respondents ' contention is correct or not."
REASONING,"Once the dispute is found to be within the scope of the arbitration clause, it is no part of the province of the court to enter into the merits of the dispute."
RPC,"In the result, we allow this appeal, set aside the judgment of the appellate Bench of the High Court and re store the order of Sinha J."
RPC,The appellants will be entitled to their costs throughout.
RPC,MAHAJAN J. I agree with my brother Fazl Ali that this appeal be allowed with costs.
RPC,Appeal allowed.

COUNSEL,"M.C. Setalvad, Attorney General for India, for the Union of India (Intervener in Petition No. 149)."
JUDGE,The Judgment of the Court was delivered by CHANDRASEKHARA AIYAR J.
FACTS,"The earlier of the two petitions has been filed by one Ujagar Singh, under article 32 of the Constitution of India, for a writ of habeas corpus and for an order of release from detention."
FACTS,The latter petition is a similar one by one Jagiit Singh.
FACTS,"In both the petitions, the respondent is the State of Punjab."
FACTS,The orders of deten tion were made under the preventive Detention Act IV of 1950.
FACTS,"The petitions are not connected with each other, except that they raise the same grounds."
FACTS,"In petition No. 149 of 1950, Ujagar Singh was originally arrested and detained under the East punjab Public Safety Act on 29th September, 1948.He was released on 28th March, 1949, but on the same date, there was an internment order against him."
FACTS,"On 29th September, 1949, he was rearrested."
FACTS,"On 2nd March, 1950, an order of detention under the , was served on him, and on 3rd April, 1950, he was served with the grounds of detention dated 11th March, 1950."
FACTS,"Both in September, 1949, and in March, 1950, the ground alleged was ' 'You tried to create public disor der amongst tenants in Una Tehsil by circulating and dis tributing objectionable literature issued by underground communists."
FACTS,""" Additional grounds were furnished in July 1950."
FACTS,"In petition No. 167 of 1950, Jagjit Singh was arrested on 24th July, 1948."
FACTS,"under the provisions of the 759 Punjab Safety Act, 1947."
FACTS,"After the East Punjab Public Safety Act, 1949, came into force, a fresh detention order dated 14th May, 1949, was served on him and he continued to be kept in jail."
FACTS,"Grounds of detention were given to him on 7th September, 1949."
FACTS,"A fresh order of detention under the Pre ventive Detention Act (IV of 1950) dated 2nd March, 1950, was served on 7th March, 1950."
FACTS,"Grounds of detention dated 11th March, 1950, were served on him on 3rd April, 1950."
FACTS,"Both in September 1949 and April 1950, the same ground was given, i.e., ""In pursuance of the policy of the Communist Party, you were engaged in preparing the masses for violent revolutionary campaign and attended secret party meetings to give effect to this programme."
FACTS,""" Additional or supplementary grounds were served on 5th August, 1950."
FACTS,"Several contentions were advanced on behalf of the petitioners challenging the legality of their detention and urging that as the detention was unlawful and the petition ers ' fundamental right of personal liberty had been in fringed, they should be set at liberty."
FACTS,"The points taken on their behalf can be briefly summarised as follows_ As the ground of detention now mentioned was the same as the ground specified in 1948 or 1949, i.e., months earlier under the Provincial Acts, the order of detention was made mechanical ly and was really mala fide in the sense that there is nothing to show that were was any fresh satisfaction on the part of the detaining authority that detention was necessary in the interests of public order."
FACTS,"Secondly, the grounds were not given ""as soon as may be"", which is required under section 7 of the Act; and as an unusually long period of time elapsed between the order of detention and the giving of the grounds, the detention must be held to be unlawful after the lapse of a reasonable time."
FACTS,"Thirdly, the grounds given originally were so vague that they could not be said to be grounds at all such as would enable the detenu to make any representation against the order."
FACTS,"Fourthly, supplemen tary grounds could not be furnished and should not be taken into account in considering whether the 760 original order was lawful, or whether the detention became unlawful after a particular period of time."
FACTS,"Two other points of a subsidiary nature were also raised, namely that the order was bad as the period of detention was not specified therein as appears to be required by section 12 and that the grounds given did not purport to state that the authority making the order was the Governor of the State."
FACTS,There is no substance in the last two points.
FACTS,Section 12 of the Act does not require that the period of detention should be specified in the order itself where the detention is with a view to preventing any person from acting in any manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order.
FACTS,The section itself provides that he can be detained without obtaining the opinion of an Advisory Board for a period longer than three months but not exceeding one year from the date of detention.
FACTS,"Normally, the detention period shall not exceed three months, unless an Advisory Board reports before the expiration of the said period that there is in its opinion sufficient cause for such detention."
STATUTE,"See arti cle 22, clause (4), sub clause (a) of the Constitution."
STATUTE,"Under sub clause (7) (a) of the same article, Parliament may by law prescrib, the circumstances under which, and the class or classes of cases in which, a person may be detained for a period longer than three months under any law provid ing for preventive detention without obtaining the opinion of an Advisory Board in accordance with the provisions of sub clause (a) of clause (4)."
STATUTE,""" Therefore, detention for more than three months can be justified either on the ground of an opinion of the Advisory Board sanctioning or warrant ing longer detention or on the ground that the detention is to secure the due maintenance of public order, in which case it cannot exceed one year in any event, as stated."
STATUTE,in sec tion 12 of the .
FACTS,"It is thus clear that the period is not to exceed three months generally, but may go up to one year in certain special cases."
REASONING,"In view of these provisions, the non specification of any definite period 761 in the detention order is not a material omission rendering the order itself invalid."
REASONING,"Under section 3 of the , the authority to make the order is the State Government."
REASONING,"Sec tion 166 (1) of the Constitution provides that all executive action of the Government of a State, shall be expressed to be taken in the name of the Governor."
REASONING,The orders of deten tion expressly state that the Governor of Punjab was satis fied of their necessity and that they were made by his order.
REASONING,"The orders are signed no doubt by the Home Secre tary, but this is no defect."
REASONING,The communication of the grounds need not be made directly by the authority making the order.
STATUTE,Section 7 does not require this.
REASONING,The communica tion may be through recognized channels prescribed by the administrative rules of business.
REASONING,Let us now turn our attention to the main contentions.
REASONING,"There is nothing strange or surprising in the fact that the same grounds have been repeated after the lapse of several months in both the cases, when it is remembered that the petitioners were under detention and in jail during the whole of the intervening period."
REASONING,No fresh activities could be attributed to them.
REASONING,"There could only be a repetition of the original ground or grounds, whether good or bad."
REASONING,It does not follow from this that the satisfaction of the detaining authority was purely mechanical and that the mind did not go with the pen.
REASONING,"The past conduct or antecedent history of a person can be taken into account when making a detention order, and, as a matter of fact, it is largely from prior events showing the tendencies or inclinations of the man that an inference could be drawn whether he is likely even in the future to act in a manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order."
REASONING,"If the authority satisfied himself that the original ground was still available and that there was need for detention on its basis, no mala fides can be attributed to the authority from this fact alone."
REASONING,The Act does not fix the time within which the grounds should be furnished to the person detained.
REASONING,"762 It merely states that the communication must be ""as soon as may be""."
REASONING,This means reasonable despatch and what is reasona ble must depend on the facts of each case.
REASONING,No arbitrary time limit can be set down.
REASONING,The delays in the communication of the grounds in the two petitions have been adequately explained by the Home Secretary who says in this affidavits that grounds had to be supplied to nearly 250 detenus and that the printing of the necessary forms occupied some time.
REASONING,"According to him, he made an order even on 11 3 1950 for the supply of the grounds."
REASONING,The extreme vagueness of the grounds is alone left as the chief line of attack.
REASONING,"As stated already, the original ground communicated in Petition No. 149 of 1950 is ""to create public disorder amongst tenants in the Tehsil by circulating and distributing objectionable literature issued by underground communists."
REASONING,""" In the other petition, the ground is ""In pursuance of the policy of the Communist Party you were engaged in preparing the masses for violent revolu tionary campaign and attended secret party meetings to give effect to this programme."
REASONING,""" We shall leave aside for the moment the supplementary grounds furnished later."
REASONING,There can be little doubt that in both the cases the grounds furnished in the first instance were highly vague.
REASONING,"If we had only Iswar Das 's case to go by, Petition No. 30 of 1950, such vagueness by itself would constitute a justifica tion for release of the petitioners."
REASONING,"Since the date of that decision, however."
REASONING,"this Court had to consider the question at great length in two cases from Bombay and Calcutta re spectively Cases Nos. 22 and 24 of 1950 where the subject of the meaning and scope of section 7 of the and article 22, sub clauses (5) and (6)of the Constitution of India."
REASONING,came up for elaborate consideration.
REASONING,"The said cases were decided on 25th January, 1951, and we are now governed by the principles laid down in these judg ments."
PRECEDENT,It was held by a majority of the Judges in Case No. 22 of 1950 (1) State of Bombay vs Atmaram Sridhar Vaidya [1951] S.C.R. 167.
REASONING,"763 (a) that mere vagueness of grounds standing by itself and without leading to an inference of mala fides or lack of good faith is not a justiciable issue in a court of law for the necessity of making ' the order, inasmuch as the ground or grounds on which the order of detention was made is a matter for the subjective satisfaction of the Government or of the detaining authority; (b) that there is nothing in the Act to prevent particulars of the grounds being furnished to the detenu within a reasonable time, so that he may have the earliest opportunity of making a representation against the detention order what is reasonable time being dependent on the facts of each case; (c) that failure to furnish grounds with the speedy addition of such particulars as would enable the detenu to make a representation at the earliest opportunity against the detention order can be considered by a court of law as an."
REASONING,"invasion of a fundamen tal right or safeguard guaranteed by the Constitution, viz., being given the earliest opportunity to make a representa tion;and (d) that no new grounds could be supplied to strengthen or fortify the original order of detention."
REASONING,"We are not concerned so much with the earlier history of the detenus as with what happened to them under the Preven tive Detention Act, 1950."
REASONING,"OverloOking the fact that the ground mentioned In March 1950 was the same as that given in September 1949, and condoning the vagueness in the original ground furnished in both the cases to support the making Of the order, it is impossible to justify the delay of nearly four months in furnishing what have been called additional or supplementary grounds, Let us take up Petition No. 149 first."
REASONING,"In the grounds furnished in July 1950, there are several which do not apparently relate to the original ground."
REASONING,"""You were respon sible for hartal by labourers working on Bhalera Dam in October 1947"". ""You instigated labourers working in Nangal in 1948 to go on strike to secure the acceptance of their demands"" ""After release you absconded yourself from your village and 99 764 remained untraced for a considerable period"" . ""When you were re arrested on 29 9 1949, lot of objectionable communist literature was recovered from your personal search"" are instances of new grounds, and they have to be eliminated therefore from consideration."
REASONING,"In Jagjit Singh 's petition No. 167 of 1950, the supplemental grounds, which are as many as ten in number, are dated 31 7 1950, but they were served on him on 5 8 1950, that is two days after he had prepared his petition to this court under article 32 of the Constitution."
REASONING,The grounds may be taken as particulars of the general allegation made against him on 3 4 1950 when the original grounds of detention were served.
REASONING,But the time factor to enable him to make a representation at the earliest opportunity was not borne in mind or adhered to.
REASONING,"In the affidavit of Shri Vishan Bhagwan, Home Secretary to the Punjab Government, dated 6th September, 1950, no explanation has been offered for this abnormal delay in the specification of the particulars."
REASONING,This delay is very unfor tunate indeed.
REASONING,But for its occurrence the petitioner would not have been able to urge that one of the valuable rights guaranteed to him by the Constitution has been violated.
REASONING,It is not alleged b.y the Home Secretary that the detenu was furnished with these particulars when he was arrested and detained under the Provincial Act and that consequently it was considered unnecessary to give him the same particu lars once over.
REASONING,"On the other hand, the detenu 's complaint has throughout been that he was given no particulars at all till the 5th August, 1950."
REASONING,"As the petitioners were given only vague grounds which were not particularised or made specific so as to afford them the earliest opportunity of making representations against their detention orders, and their having been inex cusable delay in acquainting them with particulars of what was alleged."
REASONING,"the petitioners have to be released, the rules being made absolute."
RPC,Ordered accordingly.
RPC,I concur in the order proposed by my learned brother Chandrasekhara Aiyar J. DAS J.
RPC,"In view of the majority decision in Case No. 22 of 1950 (The State of Bombay vs Atma Ram Sridhar Acharya), I concur in the order proposed by my learned brother."

JUDGE,The judgment of the Court was delivered by PATANJALI SASTRI J.
FACTS,This is an appeal from a judgment of the High Court of Judicature at Patna dismissing a revi sion petition against the conviction of the appellant for an offence under section 186 of the Indian Penal Code.
FACTS,The appellant was at all material times the General Manager of the Jagdishpur Zamindary Company (hereinafter referred to as the company) who were the lessees of a sugar factory referred to in these proceedings as the Bhita Sugar Factory.
FACTS,"He was prosecuted for obstructing the then District Magistrate and the Special Officer incharge of Rationing, Patna, in the discharge of their official functions when they went to the factory on 6th December, 1947, to remove 5,000 maunds of sugar which had been seized out of the stock held by the company pursuant to an order of the Government of Bihar dated 5th December, 1047."
FACTS,"The case for the prose cution was as follows: The company had deliberately failed to comply with the orders for supply of sugar issued from time to time under the provisions of the Sugar and Sugar Products Control Order, 1047, by officers of the Government duly authorised in that behalf."
FACTS,"and, in consequence, the Government made the following order on 5th December, 1947 : ""In exercise of the powers conferred on the Central Government by cl."
FACTS,"(1) of sub section (2) of section 3 of the Essential Supplies (Temporary Powers) Act, 1946, which have been delegated to the Provincial Government in relation to foodstuffs in the notification of the Government of India, Department of Food, No. PY 603 (2) 1 dated 21st October, 1946, the Governor of Bihar is pleased : (1) to authorise the District Magistrate, Patna, and/or the Special Officer in charge of Rationing, Patna, to search the stock of sugar held by Messrs. Jagdishpur Zamind ary Company, Bhita, in the District of Patna, which is about to commit a contravention of 306 the order of the Chief Controller of Prices and Supplies, Bihar, made under cl. 7 (1) (ii) of the Sugar and Sugar Products Control Order, 1947, and issued in order No. 1613 P.C.R. dated 27th September, 1947, in so far as the said order relates to the said Company, and (2) to direct that 5,000 maunds of sugar held in stock by the said Company shall be seized."

FACTS,"T.P. SINGH, Secretary to Government."
FACTS,""" On the 6th December, 1947, when the officers named went to the factory to carry cut the aforesaid order, they were told by the appellant that he would do everything possible to obstruct the removal of the sugar, and accordingly it was found that the sugar godowns had been locked and the road leading to them blocked by heaps of coal, firewood and tins placed across, so as to make vehicular traffic impos sible."
FACTS,A railway siding leading to the godowns had also been rendered unserviceable by the removal of some of the rails and fishplates.
FACTS,"As a result of such obstruction, the officers had to seek the aid of armed police to break open the locks, repair the railway line and clear the road block before the sugar could be removed from the factory."
ARG,"The appellant 's main defence was that on a proper con struction of section 3 of the Essential Supplies (Temporary Powers) Act, 1946, hereinafter referred to as the Act) it was not competent for the Government to pass the order of 5th December, 1947, which was consequently illegal and void, and that obstruction to the execution of that order could not constitute an offence under section 186 of the Indian Penal Code."
RLC,The contention was rejected and the appellant was convicted and sentenced to simple imprisonment for a term of three weeks.
RLC,"On appeal, the Sessions Judge, Patna, confirmed the conviction and sentence, agreeing with the findings of the trial court, and a Revision Petition preferred by the appel lant was rejected by the High Court, 307 which, however, granted a certificate under article 134 (1) (c) of the Constitution that the case was a fit one for appeal to this court as it involved a point of ""sufficient public importance"" as to the interpretation of section 3 of the Act."
STATUTE,"Section 3, so far as it is material here, runs as follows : ""3."
STATUTE,"(1) The Central Government, so far as it appears to it to be necessary or expedient for maintaining or increas ing supplies of any essential commodity, or for securing their equitable distribution and availability at fair prices, may, by notified order, provide for regulating or prohibiting the production, supply and distribution thereof, and trade and commerce therein."
STATUTE,"(2) Without prejudice to the generality of the powers conferred by sub section (1), an order made thereunder may provide (j) for any incidental and supplementary matters, in cluding in particular the entering, and search of premises, vehicles, vessels and aircraft, the seizure by a person authorised to make such search of any articles in respect of which such person has reason to believe that a contravention of the order has been, is being, or is about to be commit ted, the grant or issue of licences, permits or other docu ments, and the charging of fees therefor."
ARG,""" It was contended that an order under sub section (1) should be in the nature of a rule or regulation of general application, like the Sugar and Sugar Products Control Order, 1947, issued by the Central Government on 4th August, 1947, as the sub section confers on the Central Government only the power to ""provide for regulating or prohibiting"" the production, supply, distribution, etc., of essential commodities, and does not authorise the making of ad hoc or special orders with respect to any particular person or thing."
REASONING,We see no reason to place such a restricted con struction on the scope of the power conferred on the Central Government.
REASONING,"The term ""notified order"" which is defined as meaning ""an 40 308 order notified in the official Gazette"" is wide enough to cover special as well as general orders relating to the matters specified in section 3."
REASONING,"The power to provide for regulating or prohibiting production, distribution and supply conferred on an executive body may well include the power to regulate or prohibit by issuing directions to a particular producer or dealer or by requiring any specific act to be done or forborne in regard to production, etc., and the provisions of section 4 lend support to that view."
REASONING,"The Central Government is empowered under the latter section to delegate its power to make orders under section 3, sub ject to conditions to be specified, to any officer or subor dinate authority either of the Central or a Provincial Government."
REASONING,"It would be strange, if, as contended for the appellant, a subordinate officer in charge, say, of a small area, should, by delegation, exercise powers of a legisla tive character in relation to the matters specified in section 3, but should not have the power of issuing special orders concerning specific individuals or things."
REASONING,We do not think that such a situation could have been contemplated.
REASONING,"The power delegated under section 4 must, in our opinion, include the power of issuing directions to any producer or dealer in relation to production, etc., of any specified essential commodity."
REASONING,"If so, the delegating authority itself must possess such power under section 3."
REASONING,"For instance, section 7 of the Sugar and Sugar Products Control Order, 1947, made by the Central Government empowers the"" Control ler"" ""to issue directions to any producer or dealer to supply sugar or sugar products"" to specified areas, persons or organisations."
REASONING,"This delegation is expressed to be made ""in exercise of the powers conferred by sections 3 and 4"" of the Act, but unless the Central Government itself had the power of issuing such directions under section 3, it could not delegate that power to the Controller under section 4."
REASONING,"This view is reinforced by the language of section 15, which contemplates orders under section 3 being made against a particular person, for it speaks of ""an order made under section 3 which prohibits him (that 309 is, the person prosecuted for its contravention) from doing any act or being in possession of a thing without lawful authority etc."
REASONING,""" The restricted construction of section 3 contended for by the appellant 's counsel would render the scheme of the Act largely unworkable, and we have no hesita tion in rejecting it."
REASONING,"Even so, it was argued, an order for seizure could be made only subject to the conditions and limitations speci fied in clause (j) of sub section (2) of section 3, that is to say, only where the person authorised in that behalf ""has reason to believe that a contravention of the order [an order made under sub section (1)] has been, is being, or is about to be committed ""."
REASONING,"In the present case, the order of 5th December, 1947, directing the seizure of 5,000 maunds of the company 's sugar, in the execution of which the appellant has been found to have obstructed the officers of the Pro vincial Government, recited that the company was ""about to commit a contravention of the order of the Chief Controller of Prices and Supplies, Bihar, made under cl. 7."
REASONING,"(1) (ii) of the Sugar and Sugar Products Control Order, 1947, and issued in order No. 1613 P.C.R. dated 27th September, 1947, in so far as the said order relates to the said company""."
REASONING,"The latter 'order, while it directed the company, among others, ""to supply sugar at the prices fixed to the approved dealers of certain Districts"", left it to the District or Sub divi sional Officer to fix quotas for the approved dealers of his District or Sub division from the District or Sub divisional allotment and to inform the company when and where the supplies are to be made."
REASONING,"It has been found by the courts below that the total quantity of sugar which the order required to be supplied was varied from time to time, and no quotas to approved dealers were ever fixed nor information sent to the company as to when and where supplies were to be made."
REASONING,"The order of the 27th September, 1947, having thus remained inchoate and incomplete and so incapable of being carried out or contravened till the 5th December, 1947, it was submitted that no seizure and removal could be lawfully ordered on the basis of an anticipated contravention 310 of such an order, and that the officers concerned in the illegal and unauthorised removal of the sugar were not acting in the discharge of their public functions."
PRECEDENT,"Reference was made in this connection to the decisions of the Calcutta High Court in Lilla Singh vs Queen Empress(1) and Queen Empress vs Jogendra Nath Mukerjee(2) where it was held that the public function in the discharge of which a public servant was obstructed must be a legal or legitimately authorised function, in order that the obstruction might constitute an offence under section 186 of the Indian Penal Code."
ARG,"On the other hand, counsel for the respondent main tained that for an offence under that section it was not necessary that the act which was obstructed must be duly authorised and otherwise lawful if it was being done or was sought to be done by a public servant honestly and in good faith believing that it was part of his public functions, and reliance was placed in support of this view on the decisions of the Madras High Court in Queen Empress vs Poomalai Udayan(3), Public Prosecutor vs Madava Bhonjo Santos(4) and Peer Masthan Rowther vs Emperor(5)."
REASONING,We think it is unnecessary for the purpose of this appeal to pro nounce on the true scope of section 186 of the Indian Penal Code as we are of opinion that the appellant 's argument must fail on another ground.
REASONING,"It is manifest that sub section (2) of section 3 confers no further or other powers on the Central Government than what are conferred under sub section (1), for it is ""an order made thereunder"" that may provide for one or the other of the matters specifically enumerated in sub section (2) which are only illustrative, as such enumeration is ""without prejudice to the generality of the powers conferred by sub section (1)"" Seizure of an article being thus shown to fall within the purview of sub section (1), it must be competent for the Central Government or its delegate, the Provincial Government, to make an order for seizure under (1) I.L.R. 22."
REASONING,(4) (2) I.L.R. (5) (3) I.L.R. 311 that sub section apart from and irrespective of the antici pated contravention of any other order as contemplated in clause (j) of sub section (2).
REASONING,"The order ' of 5th December, 1947, must, therefore, be held to be a valid order, notwith standing its reference to the order of the 27th September, 1947, as being about to be contravened."
REASONING,"If the latter order was incomplete and inoperative and consequently there could be no question of its contravention, as contended for the appellant, the reference to it in the order dated the 5th December, 1947, would be an immaterial redundancy and could not affect the validity of the latter order."
REASONING,"The seizure of the company 's sugar must, therefore, be regarded as duly authorised and lawful, and the appellant by ob structing its removal, committed an offence under section 186 of the Indian Penal Code even on the stricter construc tion placed on that provision by the Calcutta High Court."
REASONING,The view we have expressed above receives support from the decision of the Privy Council in Sibnath Banerjee 's case(1).
STATUTE,"Section 2(1) of the Defence of India Act, 1939, as amended by section 2 of the Defence of India (Amendment) Act, 1940, empowered the Central Government to make rules for securing the defence of British India, the public safe ty, the maintenance of public order, etc., and sub section (2) enacted ""without prejudice to the generality of the powers conferred by sub section (1), the rules may provide for all or any of the following matters . ""."
REASONING,"Among such matters was the detention of any person ""reasona bly suspected"" of having acted etc."
REASONING,in a manner prejudicial to the public safety etc.
REASONING,"Rule 26 of the Rules made under the section, however, authorised the Gov ernment to detain a person ""if it is satisfied"" that it was necessary to detain him with a view to prevent him from acting prejudicially. ' . .The"
REASONING,"Federal Court held (2) that this rule was ultra vires as it Went beyond the scope of clause (x) in that it left it to the satisfaction of the Government to decide whether or not it was necessary to detain a (1) ; 72 I. A.241, 248."
REASONING,"(2) 312 person, The decision was reversed and Lord Thankerton, delivering the judgment of the Board, observed: ""In the opinion of their Lordships, the function of subsection(2) is merely an illustrative one; the rule making power is con ferred by sub section (1), and ""the rules"" which are re ferred to in the opening sentence of subsection (2) are the rules which are authorised by, and made under, sub section (1); the provisions of sub section (2) are not restrictive of sub section(1), as, indeed is expressly stated by the words ""without prejudice to the generality of the powers conferred by sub section (1)""."
REASONING,"""There can be no doubt as the learned Judge himself appears to have thought that the general language of sub section (1) amply justifies the terms of rule 26, and avoids any of the criticisms which the learned Judge expressed in relation to subsection (2)""."
REASONING,This accords with our view of the effect of subsections (1) and (2) of section 3 of the Act.
RPC,The appeal is dismissed.
RPC,The appellant 's bail bond is cancelled and he is ordered to surrender.
RPC,Appeal dismissed.

COUNSEL,"S.P. Sinha (Nagendra Nath Bose, with him) for respond ents Nos. 1 to 3 in Civil Appeal No. 95 and appellants Nos. 1 to 3 in Civil Appeal No. 96."
JUDGE,The judgment of the Court was delivered by FAZL ALl J.
FACTS,"These appeals are directed against the judgment and decree of the High Court of Judicature at Fort William in West Bengal, confirming a decision of the Presi dent of the Calcutta Improvement Tribunal, which modified an award of the First Land Acquisition Collector of Calcutta, made under the Land Acquisition Act in respect of the acquisition of two premises, which may conveniently be referred to as Nos. 140 and 141, Cotton Street."
FACTS,"In order to understand the points of contest between the various claimants to the compensation awarded in the case, it seems necessary to refer to certain facts showing how they came to be interested in the premises which are the subject matter of the land acquisition proceedings."
FACTS,"These premises belonged at one time to one Sewanarayan Kalia, and afterwards they became the property of a deity, Sree Sree Iswar Gopal Jieu Thakur, installed by Sewanarayan Kalia at Chinsurah in the district of Hoogly."
FACTS,"Sewanarayan, who had three wives, died in 1836, leaving behind him his third wife, Muni Bibi, two daughters by his 334 predeceased wives, these being Jiban Kumari and Amrit Ku mari, and a mistress named Kissen Dasi."
FACTS,"On the 23rd August, 1836, these persons executed a deed of solenama which was in the nature of a family arrangement, by which the remainder of the estate of Sewanarayan (i.e., what was left after excluding the dedicated properties) was divided in the terms of his will, with the result that Muni Bibi got subject to certain conditions, among other properties, the premises described as 140, Cotton Street, and Jiban Kumari got the contiguous premises, No. 141, Cotton Street."
FACTS,Muni Bibi and Jiban Kumari also became the she baits of the Thakur or deity with power to appoint their successors.
FACTS,"On the 20th January, 1848, Muni Bibi by an arpannama dedicated 140, Cotton Street, to the Thakur."
FACTS,"It is recited in this deed, among other things, that on account of annual droughts and inundation and consequent diminution in the produce of the lands, certain properties dedicated to the sewa of the deity had been sold for arrears of revenue, that ""Jiban Kumari had been making advances from her private funds for the expenses of jatra, mahotsob etc."
FACTS,", of the deity, when the amount fell short, this being against the provisions laid down by her late husband"", that the house known as 140, Cotton Street, having been let out, was yielding a rent of Rs. 30 p.m., that after deducting the necessary expenses the surplus income left was Rs. 20 p.m., and that ""if this amount was included in the expenses for the sheba etc., of the deity every month, the provision made by her deceased husband may remain in force."
FACTS,""" After reciting these facts, it is stated that the rental of the house ""shall be permanently and perpetually included in the expenses of the sheba."
FACTS,""" About 20 years later, on the 30th September, 1869, Muni Bibi created a permanent (maurasi mokrari) lease of the premises bearing No. 140, Cotton Street, in her capacity as a shebait in favour of one Nehal Chand Panday (who was admittedly a benamidar for one Bhairodas Johurry), at a rental of Rs. 25 p.m. (See exhibit L a kabuliyat executed by Nehal Chand in favour of Muni Bibi)."
FACTS,"In the same year, on the 8th 335 December, Jiban Kumari granted a permanent lease to Bhairo das Johurry, in respect of the premises known as 141, Cotton Street at a rental of Rs. 90 p.m. (See exhibit K a kabuliy at executed by Johurry in favour of Jiban Kumari)."
FACTS,The main question which has been raised in this case is whether the two ladies were competent to give debutter properties by way of permanent lease to another person.
FACTS,"In 1870, Muni Bibi died, and, on the 15th January, 1872, Jiban Kumari ap pointed Gourimoni Devi a shebait by a registered deed and dedicated the premises known as 141, Cotton Street, to the deity."
FACTS,"Both Jiban Kumari and Gourimoni Debi died shortly afterwards, and Gopal Das, a minor son of Gourimoni, became the shebait of the idol."
FACTS,"During his minority, his father, Raghubar Dayal, became his certificated guardian, and, in that capacity, he executed a usufructuary mortgage deed in respect of the Cotton Street properties to one Lal Behari Dutt, on the 31 August, 1878."
FACTS,"After the death of Raghubar Dayal one Ajodhya Debi and after her one Kalicharan Dutta became the certificated guardian of Gopal Das, and, on the 17th August, 1890, the latter mortgaged some debutter properties including 140and 141, Cotton Street, to Lal Behari Dutt for a sum of Rs. 2,230."
FACTS,"On attaining majority, Gopaldas executed on the 17th January, 1896, a usufructuary mortgage deed in respect of all debutter properties includ ing the Cotton Street houses in favour of Lal Behari Dutt for paying the previous mortgage dues which amounted on that date to Rs. 4,955 and odd."
FACTS,"This deed provided among ' other things that the mortgagee was to collect rents, outgoings, carry on the sheba of the deity, and that whatever balance was left out of the income of the property was to go towards the satisfaction of the mortgage dues."
FACTS,"Gopaldas died in 1900, leaving behind him surviving his widow, Annapuma, who also died in 1905."
FACTS,"By 1918, Lal Behari Dutt also was dead, and his interest in the mortgaged properties, to which reference has been made, was sold to one Naba Kishor Dutt on the 12th December, 1918."
FACTS,"On the 17th November, 1933, Naba Kishor assigned the mortgagee 's 336 interest in the mortgaged properties to two of the Bagarias, respondents 1 and 2 in appeal No. 95, and m the same year the three respondents (1 to 3) also acquired the lessee 's interest in the Cotton Street houses."
FACTS,"The land acquisition proceedings, which have given rise to these appeals, were started about the year 1934 in respect of the premises bearing Nos. 140 and 141, Cotton Street, as well as two adjoining premises with which we are not concerned in this case."
FACTS,"In these proceedings, the following claims were put forward by three sets of persons: 1."
FACTS,"The Bagarias (respondents 1 to 3 in appeal No. 95) at first claimed the entire amount of compensation on the allegation that they were the absolute owners of the prem ises in question, but later on they claimed only as mortga gees and permanent lessees of those premises."
ARG,"On behalf of the deity, the entire amount of compen sation money was claimed by Deosaran Singh and Ram Lakshman Singh, who alleged themselves to be shebaits, on the basis that the premises in question were debutter properties of the deity, and the Bagarias had acquired no interest therein either by the assignment of the usufructuary mortgage or the alleged purchase of the tenant 's rights in the properties."
ARG,Respondent No. 4 claimed compensation as a lessee for 99 years on the basis of a lease alleged to have been given to him by the original landlords.
REASONING,"In the present appeals, we are concerned with the first two claims only, and we shall briefly state how they were dealt with by the Collector and the courts below."
REASONING,"On the 22nd May, 1935, the Collector awarded Rs. 31,740 as compen sation for landlord 's interests, to be shared by the deity as owner and two of the Bagarias, respondents Nos. 1 and 2 in appeal No. 95 in their capacity of usufructuary mortga gee, and awarded a sum of Rs. 1,58,000 to the respondents Nos. 1, 2 and a as compensation for their rights as perma nent tenants of the premises in question."
REASONING,"Subsequently, 3 separate petitions of reference were filed 337 by the a claimants against the Collector 's award and the reference made by the Collector in pursuance thereof was registered as apportionment case No. 95 of 1935 in the Court of the Calcutta Improvement Tribunal."
REASONING,"Meanwhile, Deosaran Singh and Ram Lakshman Singh, who had put in claims as shebaits, retired from the contest, and the President of the Tribunal appointed one Narendra Nath Rudra as the next friend of the deity to represent and protect its interests."
REASONING,"On the 31st August, 1938, the President of the Tribunal gave his decision, by which he substantially upheld the award of the Collector, but modified it in one respect only."
REASONING,"He held that the usufructuary mortgage, on the basis of which re spondents 1 and 2 had put in a claim, had been paid off and therefore they were not entitled to any compensation, and the whole sum of Rs. 31,740 should be paid to the deity."
REASONING,"Respondents 1 to 3 however were held entitled to the sum of Rs. 1,58,000 as permanent tenants, on the ground that leases had been created for legal necessity and therefore were binding on the deity, He also held that the deity was not entitled to question the leases by virtue of article 134 (a) of the Limitation Act."
REASONING,"Regarding costs, he directed that all costs incurred on behalf of the deity should be paid out of the compensation money lying in deposit in court."
RLC,"Two appeals were thereafter preferred to the High Court by the two main contesting parties and ultimately both these ap peals were dismissed, and the High Court upheld the decision of the Tribunal."
REASONING,"Subsequently, the present appeals were preferred to this Court, the deity having obtained a certif icate granting leave to appeal from the High Court, and the Bagaria respondents having obtained special leave from the Privy Council to prefer a cross appeal."
RLC,"So far as the question of legal necessity is concerned, there are concurrent findings of the Tribunal and the High Court against the appellant in appeal No. 95, but we allowed his counsel to argue the question at some length, because it was urged before us that on the facts of the case the point in issue was not a question of fact but one of mixed fact and law, especially as the decision of the High Court turned upon the construction of the leases and the inference drawn from the fact that the permanent nature of the tenancy had remained unquestioned for a very long period."
REASONING,"The tenancy in question came into existence as long ago as 1869, and it is not surprising that no direct evidence bearing on the issue of legal necessity is available now."
REASONING,"We have therefore to fall back upon the recitals in the documents, to ascertain the circumstances under which the documents, exhibits L and K, were executed, because it is well settled that if all the original parties to the trans action and those who could have given evidence on the rele vant points have passed away, a recital consisting of the principal circumstances of the case assumes greater impor tance and cannot be lightly set aside."
PRECEDENT,"[See Banga Chandra Dhar Biswas vs Jagat Kisore Chowdhuri(1) 1 It appears to us that the recitals in the documents afford valuable evidence, because the tenancies were created by two pious ladies who were keenly interested in the sheba of the deity and with regard to whom it was not suggested that they expected to derive any personal advantage from the transactions in question."
REASONING,It seems to us most unlikely that they would be parties to any untrue recitals merely to support the trans action.
REASONING,"It may be recalled here that in 1848, certain properties belonging to the deity had been sold for arrears of rent, and Jiban Kumari (1) 43 I.A. 249."
REASONING,"339 had been supplementing the income of the residue from her own properties for meeting the expenses of performing cer tain essential services to the deity, such as jatra, mahot sob, etc."
REASONING,"We also find from the arpannama that the value of the property which is the subject matter of the mokrari kabuliyat dated the 30th September, 1869 (exhibit L) was Rs. 2,000 in 1848, that it was not in the khas possession of Muni Bibi but had been let out to a tenant and that its net income was Rs. 20 p.m."
REASONING,"At the time when the arpannama was executed, Muni Bibi clearly thought that the sum of _Rs. 20 p.m., if included in the expenses for the sheba of the deity, would enable the sheba to be carried on without any extraneous help."
REASONING,"From the recitals in exhibit L, it appears that the house bearing No. 140, Cotton Street, was in a dilapidated condition and had collapsed in the rains of 1270 B.S. (1868 A.D.), and Muni Bibi was unable to bear the expenses of constructing a new building at the place."
REASONING,"The problem before her therefore was whether the deity should go without any income from this property, or she should enter into such an arrangement as would secure a permanent income for the expenses of the deity, which should not in any case be less than the income which the property had theretofore yielded."
REASONING,"She decided to choose what must have appeared to her to be the better and more prudent course, with the result that she got a sum of Rs. 500 cash for the deity as the price of the materials which were sold to the lessee, and also secured a regular monthly income of Rs. 25."
REASONING,There can be no doubt that the transaction was in the best inter ests of the deity and clearly beneficial to it.
REASONING,"A reference to the arpannama shows that the house was in the possession of a, tenant even in 1848, and from the recitals in the document it is clear that what Muni Bibi contemplated was that the house should continue to remain in the possession of a tenant, and the rent of the house should be used for the sheba of the deity."
REASONING,"At that time, she did not contemplate any other mode of using the property she was going to dedicate."
REASONING,"We do not know who was the tenant of the 340 house in 1848 and what were the commitments of Muni Bibi at that time, but, even apart from these facts, it is difficult to believe that a devout person like her, who was not only a shebait but also the widow of the founder of the deity and who had shown such keen interest for the upkeep of the worship of the deity, should have entered into the transac tion in question unless she considered it absolutely neces sary to do so."
REASONING,The contention put forward before us is that it has not been shown that there was no other course open to Muni Bibi than to.
REASONING,"grant a permanent lease in respect of the property, but it is manifest that at this distance of time no evidence can be available to show the actual pressure or necessity which impelled Muni Bibi to adopt the course she did."
REASONING,"It is now well settled that where the validity of a permanent lease granted by a shebait is called into question a long time after the grant, although it is not possible to ascertainfully what the circumstances were in which it was made, the court should assume that the grant was made for necessity so as to be valid beyond the life of the grantor."
PRECEDENT,[See Bava Magniram Sitgram vs Kasturbhai Manibhai(1)].
REASONING,"In the present case, the circumstances which can be gathered from the recitals together with the fact that the document has remained unquestioned for more than half a century, seem to us to be quite sufficient to support the conclusion that the grant was made for legal necessity and is binding on the deity."
REASONING,"On the facts narrated, it would appear that there were several shebaits between the death of Muni Bibi and the commencement of the present litigation, but the lease was never impugned as being beyond the power of the shebait who granted it."
REASONING,"On the other hand, we find that the permanent character of the lease was recognized in a deed executed by Gourimoni on the 18th October, 1873 (exhibit Y), and in a mortgage deed executed by Raghubar Dayal, the guardian of Gopaldas, on the 31st August, 1878."
REASONING,"The properties in question were subsequently mortgaged by Kali Charan Dutt and Gopaldas, but neither of these persons nor (1) 41 I. A. 54."
REASONING,341 the mortgagees ever came forward to question the permanent nature of the tenancy.
REASONING,"The counsel for the appellant relied upon exhibit VI, which is a copy of the judgment of the High Court in a suit instituted by Nabakishore Dutt in 1995 against the Adminis trator General of Bengal for the rent of the house in ques tion."
REASONING,"It appears from this judgment that the tenancy was admitted by the defendant and it was also admitted by him that rent was due, but he claimed that he was entitled to insist upon a receipt specifying the money to have been paid as mourasi mokrari rent."
REASONING,"The learned Judge, who dealt with the case, however, thought that the point raised by the defendant did not strictly speaking arise in a suit for rent, which according to him could not be converted into a suit for declaration of title, and on that basis, he passed a decree in favour of the plaintiff."
REASONING,"The judgment does not say in so many words that Nabakishore resisted the claim as to the tenancy being mourasi mokrari, but, however that may be, assuming that such an assertion was really made by him, it cannot affect the character of a tenancy which had re mained unquestioned for nearly half a century."
REASONING,"The legal position with regard to 141, Cotton Street, is almost identical with that of the adjoining premises with which we have already dealt."
REASONING,"As has been already stated, a mourasi mokrari tenancy was created by Jiban Kumari on the 8th December, 1869, as is evidenced by exhibit K."
REASONING,"This document recites among other things that the house which was the subject of the lease, ""stands in need of repairs and for want of such repairs there is chance of some portion thereof breaking down during the year."
REASONING,""" It also recites that whatever income was derived till then from that house was derived by letting it out on rent and that the mourasi tenancy was being created for the purpose of repair ing the house and keeping it in existence."
REASONING,"At the end of the document, it is stated that ""the shebait shall keep the kabuliyat and patta in force and shall on taking the sum of Rs. 90 as rent, defray the expenses of the sheba of the deity."
REASONING,""" It is 342 noteworthy that the actual dedication of this property took place on the 15th January, 1872, more than 2 years after the kabuliyat."
REASONING,"On that date, a registered deed of gift was executed by Jiban Kumari in favour of Srimathi Gourimoni Debi and it was recited therein that the income of the house was being dedicated by the former to the sheba of the deity."
REASONING,"There was also a further clause in that deed to the follow ing effect : ""In accordance with the terms of the solenama the ex penses of the Iswar seba shall be met from the income of those properties which have been dedicated for the perform ance of the work of the said seba and the amount by which the expenses for the festivals would fall short and the expenses which would be incurred for repairs to house for sheba of the said Thakur shall be met and the Tahailia (attendant) and the Brahman cook and the Brahman priest (now) employed and to be employed hereafter shall get (their) salaries, from the income of the said property."" On reading this document along with the solenama and the mok rari lease granted by Jiban Kumari, it appears that she dedicated the property after having created a mokrari lease, that what she purported to dedicate was the income derived by way of rent from the mourasi mokrari tenancy, and that she had dedicated this income for specific purposes with the object of making up the deficit in the income received from other debutter properties."
REASONING,If it is held that Jiban Kumari was an absolute owner of the property at the time the moura si mokrari lease was granted and afterwards she dedicated only the income of the property then the permanent lease cannot be assailed.
REASONING,"If, on the other hand, it is held on reading the solenama that Jiban Kumari had only a life estate in the house and it was one of the terms of the solenama that after her death the expenses of the deity were to be borne out of the income from the house, then in that case the question may arise as to whether she was entitled to create a lease beyond her lifetime."
REASONING,"Such a question however does not need an elaborate answer, because the same considerations which apply to 140, Cotton Street."
REASONING,"will 343 apply to this house, and the presumption as to necessity which is raised by the long lapse of time, would arise here also."
REASONING,"This presumption is considerably strengthened here as well as in the case of the lease granted by Muni Bibi, by the fact that the grantor of the lease was so devoted to the object of the endowment that it does not seem likely that she would have granted a permanent lease unless she was impelled to do so by absolute necessity."
REASONING,It seems to us therefore that the view taken by the High Court is substan tially correct and the respondents Nos. 1 and 2 are entitled to compensation as permanent lessees.
REASONING,"In this view, Appeal No. 95 must fail, and it is dismissed."
REASONING,"As to Appeal No. 96, it has been concurrently found by the President of the Tribunal and the High Court that the appellants have failed to prove by proper evidence that there is any money still due to them on the usufructuary mortgage executed by Gopaldas in 1886."
REASONING,"In arriving at this finding, they have dealt with every possible argument that could be urged and was urged on behalf of the appellants to show that the mortgage had not been satisfied."
REASONING,"This court has repeatedly held that it will not generally interfere with concurrent findings on a pure question of fact, and nothing has been shown on behalf of the appellants to induce us to depart from this rule."
RPC,In the result Appeal No. 96 also is dismissed.
RPC,"Having regard to the circumstances of the case, we shall make no order as to costs in either of these appeals."
RPC,Appeals dismissed.

JUDGE,1951 March 5. The judgment of the Court was delivered by MUKHERJEA J.
FACTS,"This appeal is on behalf of the decree holders in a mortgage suit and it is directed against a judgment and order of a Division Bench of the Madras High Court dated January 5, 1948, by which the 294 learned Judges reversed, on appeal, an order of the District Judge of East Tanjore made in a proceeding under section 47 and Order 21, rule 2, of the Civil Procedure Code."
FACTS,The material facts are not in controversy and may be briefly stated as follows.
FACTS,"The appellants before us are the representatives of three original plaintiffs who, as mortga gees, instituted a suit (being O.S. No. 30 of 1934) in the Court of the District Judge, East Tanjore, for enforcement of a mortgage, against the present respondent, who was defendant No. 1 in the suit, and six other persons."
FACTS,"The mortgage bond, upon which the suit was brought, was executed by defendant No. 1 for himself and his minor undivided brother, the defendant No. 2, and also as authorised agent on behalf of defendants 3 to 7 who were interested in a joint family business."
FACTS,"The suit was contested by all the defendants except defendant No. 1, against whom it proceeded ex parte, and there was a preliminary decree passed on May 15,1937, by which a sum of RS."
FACTS,"1,08,098 was directed to be paid by defendant No.1 and defendants 3 to 7, in default of which the plaintiffs were declared entitled to apply for a final decree for sale of the mortgaged properties, and the suit was dismissed against defendant No. 2."
FACTS,"Against this decree, two appeals were taken to the Madras High Court, one by defendants 3 to 7 being Appeal No. 48 of 1938 who contended that the mortgage was not binding on them or on their shares in the joint family property; and the other by the plaintiffs being Appeal No. 248 of 1938 who chal lenged the propriety of the judgment of the trial judge in so far as it dismissed their claim against defendant No. 2."
FACTS,"During the pendency of these appeals, the Madras Agricultur ists ' Relief Act (Act IV of 1938) came into force and appli cations were made by defendants 2 to 7 to the High Court, praying that in the event of a decree being passed against them, the decretal debt might be scaled down in accordance with the provisions of the Act."
FACTS,"The defendant No. 1, who did not appear at any stage of the proceeding, did not make any such application."
RLC,"The High Court forwarded 295 these applications to the lower court for enquiry into the matter and for return, with its finding on the question as to whether the applicants were agriculturists, and if so, to what extent, the decretal dues should be scaled down."
RLC,"The District Judge, ' after making enquiries, submitted a finding that the applicants were agriculturists and that the debt, if scaled down, would amount to Rs. 49,255 with interest thereupon at 6% per annum from 1st of October, 1937, exclu sive of costs."
RLC,"On receipt of this finding, the appeals were set down for final hearing and by their judgment dated March 23, 1942, the learned Judges of the High Court accepted the finding of the court below and held that defendants 2 to 7 were entitled to have the debts scaled down; but as no application had been made on behalf of defendant No. 1, he was held entitled to no relief under the Act."
RLC,A decree was drawn up in accordance with the judgment.
RLC,"The amount due by defendants 2 to 7 was stated to be Rs. 49,255 with inter est thereon at 6% per annum; while, so far as defendant No. 1 was concerned, the decree of the trial judge was affirmed subject to a slight modification regarding the rate of interest."
RLC,"The defendant No. 1 thereupon filed an applica tion in the court of the District Judge, East Tanjore, claiming relief under the Agriculturists ' Relief Act alleg ing that he too was an agriculturist and hence entitled to the benefits of the Act."
RLC,"The application was dismissed on February 25, 1943, on the ground that as the decree had already been passed by the High Court definitely negativing his claim to any relief under the Agriculturists ' Relief Act, such application was not entertainable by the lower court."
RLC,"The next step taken by the defendant No. 1 was to file an application in the High Court itself, praying for setting aside the ex parte decree which excluded him from the benefits of Act IV of 1938."
RLC,"This application was re jected by the High Court on December 13, 1943."
RLC,"As no payment was made in accordance with the prelimi nary decree passed by the High Court, a final decree in terms of the same was passed by the 296 District Judge on September 25, 1943. ' Proceedings for execution of this final decree were started on August 16, 1944, in E.P. 2 of 1945 of the court of the District Judge, East Tanjore."
FACTS,"Two lots of the mortgaged properties were put up to sale and purchased by the decree holders for a total sum of Rs. 12,005 on July 15, 1946."
FACTS,"The sale was con firmed on August 17, 1946, and part satisfaction of the decree was entered for that amount."
FACTS,"Apparently, certain terms of settlement were thereafter offered by the judgment debtors."
FACTS,"The estate of the decree holders was in the hands of the Receivers and from the Receivers ' report dated January 10, 1947, it appears that the Receivers agreed with the sanction of the court, to receive Rs. 24,000 only from or on behalf of defendant No. 2 and release him and his share of the mortgaged property from the decretal charge."
FACTS,"Likewise, the Receivers were agreeable to receive Rs. 48,000 from defendants 3 to 7 and to release them and their proper ties from the decretal debt."
FACTS,"With regard to defendant No. 1, the proposal, which seems to have been accepted by the Receivers, was that the amount payable by him under the decree was to be settled at Rs. 37,500 and one Yacob Nadar would 'pay this amount on his behalf on consideration of the decree against defendant No. 1 being assigned to him by the Receivers excluding the rights of the latter to execute the decree against defendants 2 to 7 as scaled down by the High Court."
FACTS,"The records of the execution case show that on January 20, 1947, a sum of Rs. 24,000 was paid on behalf of defend ant No. 2; and his properties, namely, lots 2 and 6 were exonerated from the decree."
FACTS,"On January 27, 1947, a sum of Rs. 30,000 was paid by defendants 3 to 7 and on February 17 following, they paid a further sum of Rs. 18,610 12 0."
FACTS,"These three amounts aggregated to Rs. 72,610 12 0."
FACTS,"Nothing was done towards the payment of the sum of Rs. 37,500 by defend ant No. 1 or by Yacob Nadar, but on March 6, 1947, the defendant No. 1 deposited in court a sum of Rs. 3,215 and put in a petition under section 47 and 297 Order 21, rule 2, Civil Procedure Code, praying that as the amount thus deposited together with the payments already made completely wiped off the amount due under the decree as scaled down by the High Court in favour of defendants 2 to 7, full satisfaction of the decree might be recorded exoner ating the mortgaged properties and also the defendant No. 1 himself from any further liability in respect of the decre tal debt."
FACTS,"The position taken up by defendant No. 1, in substance, was that the mortgage debt was one and indivisible and even though different amounts were mentioned as payable by two groups of defendants in the decree, the decree holders were bound under the terms of the decree to release the entire mortgaged property even on payment of the amount directed to be paid by defendants 2 to 7."
FACTS,"In other words, even though the defendant No. 1 's application for relief under the Madras Agriculturists ' Relief Act was expressly rejected and he was held liable for the entire amount of the mortgage debt, he would still be entitled to avail himself of the benefit of the scaling down of the decree in favour of defendants 2 to 7."
RLC,"This contention was negatived by the District Judge, but was accepted by the High Court on appeal, who allowed the application of defendant No. 1 and directed that the court below should enter up full satisfac tion of the mortgage decree."
FACTS,It is against this judgment that the decree holders have come up on appeal to this court.
REASONING,The learned Judges of the High Court observed at the outset that in the working of the Madras Agriculturists ' Relief Act alongside the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act several curious and novel situations had arisen for which it was not possible always to find logical solu tions.
REASONING,"They then proceeded to discuss the various decisions of the Madras High Court which had a bearing on this point and the conclusion which they reached may be summed up in their words as follows: ""It is no doubt somewhat odd that when a person is declared liable to pay a larger amount he should on 298 payment or tender of a smaller amount get his property exonerated from liability but this is inherent in and arises out of the proposition established by the decisions already dealt with, namely, that by the application of the principle of unity and indivisibility of a mortgage decree a non agriculturist can indirectly get relief which he cannot directly get""."
REASONING,It seems to us that the High Court 's approach to the case has not been a proper one and the conclusion it has reached cannot be supported in law.
REASONING,The learned Judges appear to have overlooked the fact that they were sitting only as an executing court and their duty was to give effect to the terms of the decree that was already passed and beyond which they could not go.
REASONING,"It is true that they were to interpret the decree, but under the guise of interpretation they could not make a new decree for the parties."
REASONING,"As said above, the mortgage decree was scaled down by the High Court in favour of defendants 2 to 7 only and the amended decree directs that the said defendants do pay into court the sum of Rs. 49,255 with certain interest and costs on payment of which the plaintiff was to bring into court all the documents in his power or possession relating to the mortgage and reconvey or retransfer the property if so required."
REASONING,"So far as defendant No. 1 is concerned, the decree states in clear and express terms that he is to pay the sum of Rs. 1,05,000 and odd and it is on payment of this sum only that redemption would be allowed of the mortgaged property."
REASONING,"If the decision of the High Court is correct, this direction in the decree would be manifestly unmeaning and without any effect."
REASONING,"What is said, however, on behalf of the respondent is that he is not claiming any benefit in viola tion of this clause."
REASONING,"By virtue of the decree against defend ants 2 to 7 being satisfied, the entire mortgaged property would, by force of the very decree, be freed from the debt and if the respondent gets any benefit thereby, such benefit would be merely incidental or consequential in its nature."
REASONING,"The High Court agreed in substance with this contention 299 and based its decision entirely upon the view that by opera tion of the principle of indivisibility of the mortgage decree, a non agriculturist debtor, whose debt has not been scaled down under the provisions of the Agriculturists ' Relief Act, may indirectly get the benefit of the relief which has been granted to his agriculturist co debtor under the provisions of the Act."
REASONING,"The general law undoubtedly is that a mortgage decree is one and indivisible and exceptions to this rule are admitted in special circumstances where the integrity of the mortgage has been disrupted at the instance of the mortgagee himself; e.g., when there is severance of the interests of the mort gagors with the consent of the mortgagee or a portion of the equity of redemption is vested in the latter."
REASONING,"It is to be noted, however, that the Madras Agriculturists ' Relief Act is a special statute which aims at giving relief not to debtors in general but only to a specified class of debtors, viz., those who are agriculturists as defined in the Act."
REASONING,"To this extent it trenches upon the general law and section 7 of the Act expressly provides that ""notwithstanding any law, custom, contract or decree of court to the contrary, all debts payable by an agriculturist at the commencement of this Act shall be scaled down in accordance with the provi sions of this chapter""."
REASONING,"Thus in case of a mortgage debt when the loan has been advanced to more than one person, if one of the debtors happens to be an agriculturist while others are not, the agriculturist debtor would certainly be enti tled to have his debts scaled down under the provisions of the Act in spite of the provision of general law which prevents a mortgagor from denying the liability of the interest which he owns in the mortgaged property to satisfy the entire mortgage debt."
REASONING,"There is, therefore, nothing wrong in law in scaling down a mortgage decree in favour of one of the judgment debtors, while as regards others the decree is kept intact."
PRECEDENT,"The Madras High Court expressly adopted this view in Rainier vs Srinivasiah (1), which is one of the (1) [1940] 2 M. 39 39 300 decisions referred to in the judgment appealed from."
REASONING,"The fact that in that case it was a puisne mortgagee and not a mortgagor whose application for relief under section 19 of the Madras Agriculturists ' Relief Act was allowed, does not make any difference in principle."
REASONING,"The puisne mortgagee was made a party defendant in the suit instituted by the first mortgagee to recover his dues and as the puisne mortgagee was liable to pay the debt due to the first mortgagee, he was held to be a debtor and hence entitled to claim the benefit of section 19 of the Agriculturists ' Relief Act."
REASONING,"It may be mentioned here that section 14 of the Madras Agricul turists ' Relief Act which provides for separation of a debt incurred by a Hindu family, some members of which are agri culturists while others are not, affords a clear indication that the splitting up of a debt in such circumstances is quite in accordance with the scheme of the Act."
REASONING,"The catena of cases upon which the learned Judges of the High Court relied in support of their decision seems to proceed on a different principle altogether and whether that principle is right or wrong, it has, in our opinion, no application to a case like the present."
REASONING,"In this class of cases, the mortgagors were agriculturists and hence entitled to have their debts scaled down under the Agriculturists ' Relief Act, but there were purchasers of the mortgaged property who were not agriculturists, and the question arose whether a purchaser could get the benefit of the debt scaled down in favour of the original debtors."
REASONING,This question was answered in the affirmative.
PRECEDENT,"The reason for taking this view was thus given by the learned Judges in Arunachalam Pillai vs Seetharam(1), where the purchase of the equity of redemp tion was at an execution sale: ""When the 12th respondent purchased the properties in court auction, he took them subject to the burden of the appellant 's mortgage and if the burden is by reason of the provisions of section 8 refer.red to above reduced without pay ment, the purchase proves to that (1) 301 extent an advantageous one, and there is nothing in the Act to deprive him of the fruits of his."
REASONING,"lucky purchase, even though he is not an agriculturist."
REASONING,"He gets the benefit of the scaling down not because the provisions of the Act apply to him, for obviously they do not, but because such benefit is a necessary incident of his purchase under the general law and the Act does not deprive him of it."
PRECEDENT,""" A somewhat different reason was assigned in Pachigola vs Karatam(1) which however was a case where a portion of the."
REASONING,equity of redemption was transferred to a purchaser by a private sale.
REASONING,"It was held that the court by allowing the mortgagor to redeem the mortgage sale was not conferring on the purchaser, a non agriculturist, the benefit of the Act, as he would have to refund to his vendor the purchase money reserved with him which as a result of the scaling down he would not have to pay to the mortgagee."
REASONING,"In both these cases, the question was raised in the proceeding for scaling down of the decree under the provisions of the Agricultur ists ' Relief Act itself and not at the execution stage."
REASONING,"There is however the case of Subramanian vs Ramachandra (2), where the question arose in course of execution pro ceedings and a purchaser of a portion of the equity of redemption was held to be entitled to the benefit of the scaled down decree in favour of the mortgagors, although his own application for relief under the Act was refused."
REASONING,It is not necessary for purposes of this case to express any opinion as to the correctness or otherwise of these deci sions.
REASONING,It is enough to say that the ratio decidendi in all these cases is not applicable to the case before us.
REASONING,"In the present case there is no purchaser of the mortgaged property and consequently there is no question of the pur chaser, who is not an agriculturist himself, being entitled to the benefit of a decree which has been scaled down in favour of the agriculturist mortgagor."
REASONING,"Here the judg ment debtors are the mortgagors themselves and according to the plain provisions of the Agriculturists ' Relief Act there could (1) (2) 302 not be any objection to a decree for reduced amount being passed against an agriculturist debtor, while the same relief is not given to his co debtors who do not fulfil that description."
REASONING,Some exception could undoubtedly be taken to the form and wording of the decree that has been passed in the present case.
REASONING,"The decree, in our opinion, should not only have stated the amount payable by defendant No. 1 and that by defendants 2 to 7 separately but should have expressly directed ,that on payment of the amount directed to be paid by defendants 2 to 7 their interest alone in the mortgaged property would not be liable to be sold."
REASONING,"The further direc tion should have been that in case they did not pay this amount, the whole of the mortgaged property including their interest would be sold for the entirety of the mortgage debt for which defendant No. 1 was made liable."
REASONING,"It is true that the decree contains no such clear directions but reading the decree as a whole and having regard to the actual decision in the case, this must be taken to be its plain implica tions."
REASONING,"The subsequent agreement between the parties arrived at in course of the execution proceedings by which the decreeholders agreed to release the interest of defendant No. 2 and that of defendants 3 to 7 separately on payment of certain specified amounts by 'them proceeds clearly on the assumption that the mortgage debt and the security have been split up, and in our opinion it is not possible for the defendant No. 1 to contend that the mortgage debt remained indivisible."
RPC,Our conclusion is that the view taken by the District Judge was right and should not have been disturbed.
RPC,"The result is that the appeal is allowed, the order of the High Court is set aside and that of the District Judge restored."
RPC,We make no order as to costs of this appeal.
RPC,Appeal allowed.

JUDGE,The judgment of the Court was deliv ered by MAHAJAN J.
FACTS,This appeal arises out of Suit No. 9 of 1939 instituted in the Court of the Subordinate Judge of Palamau by the appellants against the respondents for a number of declarations in respect to the title to certain lands and for an injunction restraining the respondents from proceed ing with a rent suit.
FACTS,The suit was decreed by the Subordi nate Judge but on appeal this decision was reversed by the High Court of Judicature at Patna and the appellants ' suit was dismissed.
FACTS,The salient facts of the case are as follows: Village Darha belonged to a family of Pathaks as their ancestral lakhraj.
FACTS,Over a hundred years ago the Pathaks granted the entire village in mokarrari to the ancestors of the family of Singhas (defendants ' first and second parties) at an annual jams of Rs. 24.
FACTS,"The mokarrari interest eventually devolved on three branches of the Singha family, each branch getting in the following proportions: Parameshwar Dayal and others, defendants ' first party, to the extent of six annas; Bisheswar Dayal Singh, defendants ' second party, to the extent of eight annas; and Madho Saran Singh, to the extent of two annas."
FACTS,"Subsequently, the two anna share of Madho Saran Singh was purchased by Hiranand Jha, father of the plaintiffs, jointly with."
FACTS,Durganand Jha and Dharam Dayal.
FACTS,Dharam Dayal was a mere benamidar for Hiranand Jha.
FACTS,"On the 5th June, 1916, Bisheshwar Dayal Singh purchased six anna share in the lakhraj interest from Deolal Pathak and others and on the 9th February, 1917, he purchased another two anna share from Mandil Pathak."
FACTS,By virtue of these purchases he came to own the lakhraj interest to the extent of eight anna share.
FACTS,He already held the mokarrari interest to the same extent which had devolved on him by inheritance.
FACTS,"Some time in the year 1917 or 1918 Hiranand Jha and Durganand Jha, who had acquired by purchase two anna mokar rari interest of Madho Saran Singh, 155 purchased in execution of a rent decree the raiyati interest in the whole village and came into possession of it."
FACTS,They thus became mokarraridars of two anna share and raiyats of sixteen annas of the village lands.
FACTS,"In the year 1918, Title Suit No. 59 of 1918 was insti tuted in the court of the Subordinate Judge of Palamau for partition of the lands situate in several villages and belonging to the family of the defendants ' first and second parties."
FACTS,"The Jhas were impleaded as defendants in ' the suit, being co sharers in part of the property in suit."
FACTS,"This suit was decreed in the year 1921, and in the final partition an allotment of two annas share in Darha village was made in their favour."
FACTS,"The remaining fourteen anna share excluding khatian 1, 3 and 6 was allotted to the defendants ' first party."
FACTS,These three khatians were allotted to Bisheshwar Dayal Singh and in exchange for the remaining portions of his interest in that village he was given some property in village Holeya.
FACTS,"The result of the partition proceedings was that the defendants ' first party came to hold fourteen anna mokarrari interest in village 'Darha, Bisheshwar Dayal Singh 's interest was limited to three khatians only, and the Jhas got a separate allotment for their two anna share in the mokarrari."
FACTS,"It appears that some time about the year 1926 the lakhraj interest holders, i.e., the Pathaks and Bisheshwar Dayal Singh, were in default in the payment of the cess due to Government."
FACTS,"On the 17th August, 1926, pro ceedings were taken against them for recovery of the cess and their interest was sold in execution of a certificate on the 18th October, 1927, to one Bijainandan Sahay."
FACTS,The sale obviously was of the lakhraj interest.
FACTS,"This was confirmed on the 19th December, 1927, and a sale certificate was issued on the both March, 1928."
FACTS,"This was followed by deliv ery of possession on 15th July, 1928."
FACTS,"Possession was ob tained by one Kamta Prasad who had acquired this interest from Bijainandan Sahay on the 20th April, 1928."
FACTS,"On the 1st May, 1933, Kamta Prasad transferred his interest in the village to the plaintiffs who thus became proprietors of sixteen anna share in the village and mokarraridars as to two anna 156 share and raiyats of the entire sixteen annas in the whole village."
FACTS,"On the 21st September, 1934, the defendants ' first party as mokarraridars brought a suit against the plaintiffs for arrears of raiyati rent for the years 1338 39 F. to the extent of six annas share and for the years 134041 F. to the extent of fourteen anna share claiming that under the parti tion decree they got a fourteen anna share in the mokarrari interest in the village."
ARG,"Plaintiffs contested the suit alleging that Bisheshwar 's mokarrari interest had merged in the lakhraj interest that was purchased by him from the Pathaks in the years 1916 17, and that by the sale under the Government 's certificate his whole eight anna interest in the village including both the lakhraj and the mokarrari had passed on to the plaintiffs and that the defendants ' first party could only claim rent from them to the extent of the six anna share in the mokarrari."
RLC,This plea was disallowed and the defendants ' first party 's claim for rent was decreed in full.
RLC,The decree was upheld on appeal and second appeal.
RLC,"The question of title was, however, left open."
FACTS,In the year 1938 another suit for rent was filed by the defendants ' first party as mokarraridars to recover fourteen anna share of the rent for the years subsequent to fasli 1341.
FACTS,"As a result of this suit, the plaintiffs brought the present suit for declaration and injunction on the allegation that the eight anna mokarrari interest of Bisheshwar Dayal Singh had merged in his lakhraj interest, that by the certificate sale Bisheshwar Dayal Singh lost all his interest in the village both lakhraj and mokarrari by reason of merger, that the partition decree of the year 1921 was illegal and in any case, under that decree the defendants ' first party got only six anna mokarrari interest and were entitled to realize rents from the tenants only to that extent."
REASONING,An injunction was also claimed restraining the defendants from proceeding with the rent suit.
ARG,"In the plaint, it was alleged that there was a private partition between the mokarraridars by virtue of which the lands of village Darha were divided between the three sets of mokarraridars, each set being 157 in separate possession of its own separate and defined shares."
ARG,"It was also pleaded that there was another parti tion between the proprietors of the lakhrai interest, that is, between Bisheshwar Dayal Singh on the one hand and Deolal Pathak, Neman Pathak and Surajnath Pathak on the other, by virtue of which the lands that were in mokarrari patties of Parmeshwar Dayal Singh and others and Hiranand Jha and Durganand Jha fell in the patti of Deolal Pathak and others, while, the lands that were in the mokarrari patti of the defendants ' second party fell in his proprietary lakhraj patti and that as a result of these partitions the mokarrari interest of the defendants ' second party merged in his lakhraj interest and under a certificate sale the whole of his interest passed to the plaintiffs."
RLC,The trial Judge held that both the partitions alleged by the plaintiffs in paragraphs 5 and 8 of their plaint were proved and that the mokarrari interest of Bisheshwar Dayal Singh merged in his lakhraj interest and that at the certif icate sale the purchaser acquired his complete interest both lakhraj and mokarrari along with the eight anna lakhraj interest of the Pathaks and that the defendants ' first party were mokarraridars of six anna interest in the village and to that extent were entitled to a decree in their rent suit and could not claim a decree for rent to the extent of fourteen anna share.
RLC,The High Court in appeal held that none of the partitions alleged by the plaintiffs were proved and that the mokarrari interest of eight annas could not merge in the lakhrai interest of sixteen annas held jointly by Bisheshwar Dayal Singh with the Pathaks.
REASONING,As a result of this decision the plaintiffs ' suit was dismissed.
REASONING,In this appeal it was contended by the learned counsel for the appellants that the High Court had erroneously held that the two partitions set up by the plaintiffs in para graphs 5 and 8 had not been proved.
REASONING,"It was argued that the evidence on the record, both documentary and oral, fully established the fact of the two partitions and that in view of these partitions it should have been held that Bisheshwar Dayal Singh 158 became separate owner of eight anna lakhraj interest and in that interest his mokarrari interest of eight annas merged, and that under the certificate sale the whole of this inter est passed on to the purchaser in execution and that being so, the defendants ' first party could only maintain a suit for recovery of rent from the raiyats to the extent of their six anna mokarrari interest."
REASONING,"In our opinion, this appeal can be disposed of on a short point without taking into consideration the respective contentions of the parties raised before us or urged in the two courts below."
REASONING,The plaintiffs ' case rests solely on the allegation of merger of the eight anna lakhraj interest of Bisheshwar Dayal Singh with his mokarrari interest to the same extent.
REASONING,"It, however, seems to us that there was no scope for the application of the doctrine of merger to the facts disclosed by the plaintiffs in their plaint."
REASONING,"If the lessor purchases the lessee 's interest, the lease no doubt is extinguished as the same man cannot at the same time be both a landlord and a tenant, but there is no extinction of the lease if one of the several lessees purchases only a part of the lessor 's interest."
REASONING,In such a case the leasehold and the reversion cannot be said to coincide.
REASONING,"It was the plaintiffs ' case that mauza Darha was orginally granted in mokarrari under a single contract of lease and it was by inheritance that the lessee 's interest devolved on three branches of the family, Bisheshwar Dayal Singh getting an interest of eight annas in the whole of the leasehold."
REASONING,He then purchased a six anna interest in the entire reversion in the year 1916 and another two anna interest in it in the year 1917.
REASONING,By these purchases he became a joint owner in the entire lakhraj holding to the extent of a moiety.
REASONING,"He, however, never came to own the entire lakhraj interest in the village or the entire mokarrari interest therein."
REASONING,"There was thus no coalescence of the interest of the lessor and the lessee in the whole of the estate which was subject to lakhraj and mokarrari interests and that being so, the mokarrari interest of Bisheshwar Dayal Singh did not merge in his lakhrai interest."
REASONING,159 Mere purchase by Bisheshwar Dayal Singh of portions of the lakhrai interest could not bring about an extinction of the lease or break its integrity as he was only one of the several joint holders of the mokarrari interest.
REASONING,"An inter se partition of the mokarrari interest amongst the mokarrari dars as alleged by the plaintiffs could not affect their liability qua the lessor for the payment of the whole rent, as several tenants of a tenancy in law constitute but a single tenant, and qua the landlord they constitute one person, each constituent part of which possesses certain common rights in the whole and is liable to discharge common obligations in its entirety."
PRECEDENT,"In the words of Lord Halsbury in White vs Tyndall(1), the parties to whom a demise is made hold as tenants in common but what they covenant to pay is one rent, not two rents and not each to pay half a rent but one rent."
REASONING,There is a privity of the estate between the tenant and the landlord in the whole of the leasehold and he is liable for all the covenants running with the land.
REASONING,"In law, therefore, an inter se partition of the mokarrari interest could not affect the integrity of the lease and it could not be said that Bisheshwar Dayal Singh under the alleged partition became a mokarraridar under another con tract of lease."
REASONING,Such partitions amongst several lessees inter se are usually made for convenience of enjoyment of the leasehold but they do not in any way affect the integri ty of the tenancy or make each holder of an interest in it as a separate holder of a different tenancy.
REASONING,In the present case there was not even an allegation that the tenancy was severed and the several tenancies came into existence as a result of the partition qua the landlord.
REASONING,Similarly the allegation of partition inter se among the several owners of the lakhraj holding could not in any way affect the integri ty of the lease in the absence of an allegation of a fresh contract between the split up owners of the holding and the different owners in the mokarrari interest.
REASONING,The lakhraj holding in the village still remains a single holding and it was not alleged that it was split up in different holdings. 'All owners (1) 13 App.
REASONING,263 21 160 of the lakhraj interest are jointly responsible for payment of the cess to Government and it was because of their de fault in payment of the cess that the whole lakhraj interest was sold in the certificate sale.
REASONING,In this situation none of the conditions necessary for the application of the doctrine of merger can be said to have been made out by the allega tions made in the plaint.
REASONING,"On the plaintiffs ' own case the lease is still a live one in respect of the six anna inter est of the defendants ' first party and in these circum stances it is not possible to hold that it has become ex tinct to the extent of eight anna interest of Bisheshwar Dayal Singh in the absence of any allegation that any fresh contract, express or implied, was arrived at between the parties."
REASONING,The leasehold has not in any way been drowned in the reversion and both lakhraj and mokarrari interest are still intact.
REASONING,"For the reasons given above we agree with the decision of the High Court that Bisheshwar Dayal Singh 's interest in the mokarrari did not merge in his lakhraj interest and that under the certificate sale it did not pass to the execution purchaser; on the other hand, it vested in the defendants ' first party by reason of the family partition and they became entitled as mokarraridars to recover rent from the plaintiffs ' raiyats to the extent of fourteen annas share."
REASONING,All that passed at the certificate sale to the execu tion purchaser and subsequently to the plaintiffs was merely the lakhraj interest of the Pathaks and of Bisheshwar Dayal Singh and it could not be that at this sale qua one judg ment debtor a larger interest passed to the execution pur chaser than in respect of the other debtor.
RPC,"In view of our decision that the doctrine of merger has no application to the facts of the case, the plaintiffs ' case is bound to fail."
RPC,We accordingly hold that there is no substance in this appeal and we dismiss it with costs.
RPC,Appeal dismissed.
NAME,"Chandrasingh Manibhai And Others vs SURJIT LAL LADHAMAL CHHABDAAND OTHERS on 23 February, 1951"
CITATION,"Appeal (Civil Appeal No. 57 of 1950) from a judgment and decree of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay dated 1st April, 1948, in Appeal No. :365 of 1947 reversing a judgment of the Joint Civil Judge at Ahmedabad, dated 14th October, 1947, in Suit No. 174 of 1945."
COUNSEL,"C.K. Daphtary (Sri Narain Andley, with him) for the respondents."
COUNSEL,February 23.
JUDGE,The judgment of the Court was deliv ered by MAHAJAN J.
FACTS,"The appellants are owners of a property known as ""Bharat Bhuvan Theatre"" at Ahmedabad."
FACTS,The respond ents are the lessees of the said theatre.
FACTS,"The term of the lease was to expire on the 2nd 222 December, 1945, unless the lessees gave to the land lords three months previous notice in writing of their intention of exercising their option of renewal of the lease for a further period of two years."
FACTS,"On the 13th December, 1945, the appellants filed the suit out of which this appeal arises for ejectment of the respondents and for recovery of certain amounts."
FACTS,"This suit was decreed on the 14th October, 1947, on the following findings: (1) that the respondents had not exercised the option of the renewal of the lease according to the stipulations contained in the lease, (2) that they had committed breaches of the terms of the lease, and (3) that they were not protected by the Rent Restriction Act."
FACTS,An enquiry was directed into the amount of mesne prof its.
FACTS,"The respondents filed an append in the High Court against the decree of the Joint Civil Judge on the 10th November, 1947."
FACTS,"The appeal was heard by a Bench of the High Court (Weston and Dixit JJ.) on the 26th February, 1948, and was decided on the 1st April, 1948."
FACTS,The judgment and decree of the Joint Civil Judge were reversed and the plaintiff 's suit was dismissed.
RLC,The High Court affirmed the finding of the trial court on the first point and held in agreement with it that the respondents had not proved that they gave three months previous notice in writing to the appellants for renewal of the lease as required by clause 4 (2) of the lease.
RLC,It reversed the finding of the trial Judge on the point that the respondents had committed breaches of the terms contained in clause 2 (20) of the lease.
FACTS,"Finally, it reached the conclusion that although the decree appealed from was right on the date it was made, yet in view of the altered circumstances created by reason of coming into operation of Act LVII of 1947 the appellants were not enti tled to recovery of possession of the suit premises."
FACTS,"Being aggrieved by the judgment of the High Court, the appellants obtained a certificate and filed an appeal in this court on the 7th March, 1949, and it is now before us for decision."
ARG,"It was contended before the High Court that the appeal being in the nature of a rehearing, it should be 223 decided in accordance with the provisions of Act LVII of 1947 which came into force on the 13th February, 1948, and not in accordance with the provisions of the Act in force at the time when the decree was passed by the trial court."
ARG,"In other words, the contention was that there having been a change in the law after the date of the decree passed by the trial Judge and before the appeal was heard, the rights of the parties should be determined in accordance with the law as it stood on the date of the hearing of the appeal."
RLC,The High Court gave effect to this contention and set aside the decree made for ejectment of the respondents.
ARG,"Learned counsel for the appellants challenged the deci sion of the High Court before us on three grounds: (1) that assuming that the appeal had to be decided by the High Court in accordance with the provisions of Act LVII of 1947, the provisions of that Act had no application to pending ap peals which had been excluded from its ambit; (9,)that Act LVII of 1947 had been amended by Bombay Act III of 1949 and that the appeal pending in this court should be decided in accordance with the provisions of the amended Act which excluded pending appeals from the purview of Act LVII of 1947; and (3) that the High Court wrongly reversed the trial court 's finding that the respondents had committed breaches of the terms contained in clause 2 (20) of the lease."
ARG,The learned counsel for the respondents besides controverting the contentions raised on behalf of the appellants contended that both the courts had erred in holding that the respondents had not proved that they exer cised the option of renewal of the lease according to the stipulations contained therein.
REASONING,"In our opinion, the decision of the appeal depends solely on the construction of sections 12 and 50 of Act LVII of 1947."
REASONING,The point whether the option of renewal was exercised according to the covenants of the lease is concluded by a concurrent finding of fact and nothing that Mr. Daphthary said in support of his contention in any way shakes that finding.
REASONING,The case must therefore be decided on the assump tion that the respondents did not exercise the option given to them under the lease for its renewal.
REASONING,We are also not impressed with the argument of the learned counsel for the appellants that the High Court wrongly reversed the finding of the trial Judge on the point that the respondents commit ted breaches of the terms of the tease.
REASONING,We should not howev er be taken to concur in all the reasons given by the High Court for reversing that finding.
REASONING,Whether the High Court was right in holding that the provisions of Act LVII of 1947 have application to appeals pending at the time when that Act came into force; the answer to this question depends on the construction to be placed on sections 12 and 50 of Act LVII of 1947.
STATUTE,"Section 12 of the Act is in these terms: "" (1) A landlord shall not be entitled to the recovery of possession of any premises so long as the tenant pays, or is ready and willing to pay, the amount of the standard rent and permitted increases, if any, and observes and performs the other conditions of the tenancy, in so far as they are consistent with the provisions of this Act."
STATUTE,"(2) No suit for recovery of possession shall be insti tuted by a landlord against a tenant on the ground of non payment of the standard rent or permitted increases due, until the expiration of one month next after notice in writing of the demand of the standard rent or permitted increases has been served upon the tenant in the manner provided in section 106 of the ."
STATUTE,"(3) No decree for eviction shall be passed in any such suit if, at the hearing."
REASONING,"of the suit, the tenant pays or tenders in court the standard rent or permitted increases then due together with the costs of the suit."
REASONING,"225 Explanation In any case where there is a dispute as to the amount of standard rent or permitted increases recovera ble under this Act the tenant shall be deemed to be ready and willing to pay such amount if, before the expiry of the period of one month after notice referred to in sub section (2), he makes an application to the court under sub section (3) of section 11 and thereafter pays or tenders the amount or rent or permitted increases specified in the order made by the court."
REASONING,""" This is the substantive section giving protection to the tenant against ejectment."
STATUTE,Section 50 which occurs in dealing with miscellaneous matters is the repeal section.
REASONING,"It repeals the Act of 1939 and the Act of 1944, and while repealing these statutes it provides as follows: ""Provided that all suits and proceedings (other than execution proceedings and appeals) between a landlord and a tenant relating to the recovery or fixing of rent or posses sion of any premises to which the provisions of apply and all suits and proceedings by a manager of a hotel or an owner of a lodging house against a lodger for the recovery of charges for, or possession of, the accommodation provided in a hotel or lodging house situate in an area to which applies, which are pending in any Court, shall be transferred to and continued before the courts which would have jurisdiction to try such suits or proceed ings under this Act, and thereupon all the provisions of this Act and the rules made thereunder shall apply to all such suits and proceedings."
REASONING,"Provided further that (a) every order passed or act done by the Control lers under of the Bombay Rents, Hotel Rates and Lodging House Rates (Control) Act, 1944, and every order or act deemed to have been passed or done under that Part shall be deemed to have been passed or done under this Act; and (b) all proceedings pending before the Controllers under Part IV of that Act shall be transferred to and continued before the Controllers appointed under this 226 Act as if they were proceedings instituted before the Con trollers under this Act"" The High Court held that section 50 merely provided for transfer of pending suits and proceedings to courts given jurisdiction under the Act to hear them and that from its ambit execution proceedings and appeals were excluded be cause no question could arise of their being transferred from one court to another and that an appeal being a contin uation of the suit and in the nature of a re hearing, the provisions of section 12 should be applied to pending ap peals."
PRECEDENT,"The opinion expressed by the Division Bench on the construction of sections 12 and 50 of the Act was questioned in Nilkanth vs Rasiklal (J), and the matter was referred to a Full Bench."
REASONING,The Full Bench overruled the decision reached by the Division Bench on the construction of section 50 and observed that it was clear that in terms the provi sions of the new Act and the rules made thereunder are made to apply only to such suits and proceedings which are trans ferred under the provisions of this section and that its retrospective effect is confined to what is expressly stated in section 50 of the Act.
REASONING,We are in respectful agreement with the view expressed by the Full Bench.
REASONING,On a plain reading of the language of sections 12 and 50 it seems clear to us that the Act was given retrospective operation only to a limited extent and execution proceedings and appeals were excluded from this effect and were to be governed by the provisions of the law in force at the time when the decrees were passed.
REASONING,"The concluding words of section 50 ""and there upon all the provisions of this Act and the rules made thereunder shall apply to all such suits and proceedings"" fully bear out this construction."
REASONING,"Mr. Daphthary contended that the whole object of section 50 was to make provision for transfer of pending cases to courts which were given jurisdiction under the Act to hear them and the section did not concern itself with the extent of the retrospective operation of the Act, and that section 12 of the Act which gives protection to tenants should (1) A. I. R. 227 be construed as having retrospective effect."
RPC,In our opinion this contention is not sound.
REASONING,Section 50 cannot be de scribed as a section providing merely for transfer of pend ing cases to courts having jurisdiction to deal with them.
REASONING,"It is on the other hand a"" repeal"" section in the new stat ute."
REASONING,"It repeals the two earlier statutes, and while repeal ing them it provides that the repeal shall not affect ""executions and appeals"" and that the provisions of the Act shall apply to all pending suits which shall be transferred to the courts having jurisdiction to hear them under section 28 of the Act."
REASONING,We are also inclined to agree with the view of the Full Bench that section 12 is in terms prospective and not retrospective.
REASONING,Sub section (2) clearly relates to suits which may be instituted after the Act comes into force.
REASONING,It cannot apply to suits which were already pending when the Act was put on the statute book.
REASONING,"Sub section (3) which gives the right to the tenant to pay or tender the rent at the hearing of the suit only applies to those suits which may be instituted after the Act comes into operation because it in terms states ""in such suit"" and not ""in any suit""."
REASONING,"""Such suit"" can only be a suit referred to in subsec tions (2) and (3) of section 12."
REASONING,"The result therefore is that, in our opinion, the High Court erroneously applied the provisions of Act LVII of 1947 to the appeal in this case and was wrong in allowing it on that basis."
REASONING,In this view of the case it is unnecessary to deal with the alternative argument of the learned counsel that this appeal should be decided in accordance with the provisions of Act III of 1949.
RPC,We accordingly set aside the decree of the High Court dismissing the plaintiff 's suit and restore the decree of the trial Judge decreeing the plain tiff 's suit with costs.
RPC,Appeal allowed.

CITATION,"Equivalent citations: 1950 AIR 211, 1950 SCR 519 "
COUNSEL,B. Banerji for the petitioner. 
COUNSEL,"M.C. Setalvad, Attorney General for India (Gyan Chand, with him) for the opposite party. "
JUDGE,The following judgments were delivered: KANIA C.J. 
FACTS,"The petitioner who is the President of the All India Hindu Mahasabha since December, 1949, was served with an order of externment dated the gist of March, 1950, that night."
FACTS,"By that order he is directed by the District Magistrate, Delhi, not to remain in the Delhi District, and immediately to remove himself from the Delhi District and not to return to the District. "
FACTS,The order was to continue in force for three months.
FACTS,That order has been recently canceled. 
ARG,"The petitioner disputes the validity of the first order on the ground that the East Punjab Public Safety Act, 1949, under which the order was made, is an infringement of his fundamental right given under article 19 (1) (d) of the Constitution of India. "
ARG,"He further contends that the grounds of the order served on him are vague, insufficient and incomplete. "
ARG,"According to him the object of the externment order passed by the District Magistrate, Delhi, was to suppress political opposition to the policy of the Government in respect of Pakistan and the Muslim League. "
ARG,It is alleged that because the petitioner and the Hindu Mahasabha are against the Government policy of appeasement this order is served on him. 
ARG,It is therefore mala fide and illegal. 
PRECEDENT,"In support of his contention about the invalidity of the East Punjab Public Safety Act and its provisions as regards externment, counsel for the petitioner relied on the recent unreported judgments of the Patna High Court in Miscellaneous Judicial Case No. 29 of 1950, Brijnandan vs The State of Bihar, and of the High Court of Bombay in Criminal Application No. 114 of 1950, re Jai singhbhai Ishwarlal Modi."
STATUTE,It is necessary first to ascertain the true meaning of article 19 (1) (d) read with clause (5) of the same article.
FACTS,There is no doubt that by the order of extern 523 meant the right of the petitioner to freedom of movement throughout the territory of India is abridged. 
STATUTE,""" It is clear that the clause permits imposition of reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right conferred by sub clause (d)in the interests of the general public."
PRECEDENT,"The majority judgments of the Patna and the Bombay High Courts, although the impugned Acts of the State Legislatures before them were materially different on certain important points, have given clause (5) of article 19 the latter meaning. "
REASONING,"524 In my opinion, clause (5) must be given its full meaning. "
REASONING,"While the reasonableness of the restrictions has to be considered with regard to the exercise of the right, it does not necessarily exclude from the consideration of the Court the question of reasonableness of the procedural part of the law. "
REASONING,"It is obvious that if the law prescribes five years externment or ten years externment, the question whether such a period of externment is reasonable, being the substantive part, is necessarily for the consideration of the Court under clause (5). "
REASONING,"Similarly, if the law provides the procedure under which the exercise of the right may be restricted, the same is also for the consideration of the Court, as it has to determine if the exercise of the right has been reasonably restricted. "
REASONING,"I do not think by this interpretation the scope and ambit of the word ""reasonable"" as applied to restrictions on the exercise of the right, is in any way unjustifiably enlarged. "
REASONING,"it seems that the narrow construction sought to be put on the expression, to restrict the Court 's power to consider only the substantive law on the point, is not correct. "
REASONING,In my opinion this aspect of the construction of article 19 (5) has escaped the minority judgment in the two matters mentioned above. 
REASONING,I am not concerned with the conclusions of the two Courts about the invalidity of the provisions of the Acts they were asked to consider. 
ARG,"It was argued on behalf of the petitioner that under section 4 the power to make the order of externment was given to the Provincial Government or the District Magistrate, whose satisfaction was final. "
ARG,On that ground it was contended that there was an unreasonable restriction on the exercise of the citizen 's right. 
RPC,"In my opinion, this argument is unsound. "
REASONING,This is not legislative delegation. 
REASONING,The desirability of passing an individual order of externment against a citizen has to be left to an officer. 
REASONING,The satisfaction of the officer thus does not impose an unreasonable restriction on the exercise of the citizen 's right. 
RLC,So far as the Bombay High Court is concerned Chagla C.J. appears to have decided this point against the contention of the petitioner. 
RLC,"It was next urged that under section 4 (3) the order made by the District Magistrate shall not, unless the Provincial Government by special order otherwise direct, remain in force for more than three months. "
ARG,It was argued that the period of three months itself was unreasonable as the externee had no remedy during that time. 
ARG,It was contended that when the Provincial Government directed the renewal of the order no limit of time was prescribed by the legislature for the duration of the order.
ARG,The order therefore can be in operation for an indefinite period. 
ARG,This was argued to be an unreasonable restriction on the exercise of a citizen 's right. 
REASONING,"In this connection it may be pointed out that in respect of preventive detention, which is a more severe restriction on the rights of the citizen, the Constitution itself under article 22 (4) to (7) permits preventive detetion for three months without any remedy. "
REASONING,The period of three months therefore prima facie does not appear unreasonable. 
REASONING,"Under the proviso to section 4 (5) the Provincial Government is not permitted to direct the exclusion or removal from the Province of a person ordinarily residing in the Province, and similarly 526 the District Magistrate is not permitted to order the exclusion or removal of a person ordinarily resident in his district from that district. "
STATUTE,This is a great safeguard provided under the East Punjab Public Safety Act. 
REASONING,"The further extension of the externment order beyond three months may be for an indefinite period, but in that connection the fact that the whole Act is to remain in force only up to the 14th August, 1951, cannot be overlooked. -"
REASONING,"In my opinion, it is improper to start with such an assumption and decide the legality of an Act on that basis. "
REASONING,Abuse of the power given by a law sometimes occurs; but the validity of the law cannot be contested because of such an apprehension. 
REASONING,"In my opinion, therefore, this contention of the petitioner cannot be accepted. "
REASONING,"While the word ""may"" ordinarily conveys the idea of a discretion and not compulsion, reading it with the last part of the clause it seems that when an externment order has to be enforced for more than three months an absolute right is given to the cxternee to make a representation."
REASONING,He cannot make a representation unless he has furnished grounds for the order.
REASONING,In no other part of the Act a right to obtain the grounds for the order in such a case is given to him.
REASONING,"Therefore, that right has to be read as given under the first part of section 4 (6). "
REASONING,"That can be done only by reading the word ""may"" for that purpose as having the meaning of ""shall"" If the word ""may"" has to be so read for that purpose, it appears to be against the well recognised canons of construction to 527 read the same ""may"" as having a different meaning when the order is to be in force for less than three months. "
REASONING,"I do not think that by putting the meaning of ""shall"" on ""may"" in the clause, I am unduly straining the language used in the clause."
REASONING,So reading this argument must fail. 
REASONING,It was next argued that there is no provision in the Act showing what the advisory board has to do when it receives a representation.
REASONING,A reference to the advisory board necessarily implies a consideration of the case by such board. 
REASONING,The absence of an express statement to that effect in the impugned Act does not invalidate the Act.
RPC,"It was finally contended on behalf of the petitioner that the grounds for the externment order supplied to him are vague, insufficient and incomplete. "
STATUTE,"The grounds are stated as follows : ""Your activities generally and particularly since the recent trouble in East and West Bengal have been of a communal nature tending to excite hatred between communities and whereas in the present composition of the population of Delhi and the recent communal disturbances of Delhi feelings are roused between the majority and minority communities, your presence and activities in Delhi are likely to prove prejudicial to the maintenance of law and order, it is considered necessary to order you to leave Delhi."" These grounds cannot be described as vague, insufficient or incomplete. "
FACTS,"It is further stated that having regard to the recent disturbance in Delhi, the population of which is composed of both these communities, the excitement of such hatred is likely to be dangerous to the peace and maintenance of law and order. "
RPC,"Apart from being vague, I think that these grounds are specific and if honestly believed can support the order. "
REASONING,The argument that the order 528 was served to stifle opposition to the Government policy of appeasement has little bearing because the District Magistrate of Delhi is not concerned with the policy of the Government of appeasement or otherwise. 
REASONING,The order is made because the activities of the petitioner are likely to prove prejudicial to the maintenance of law and order and the grounds specified have a direct bearing on that conclusion of the District Magistrate. 
RPC,I therefore think that this contention of the petitioner must be rejected. 
JUDGE,FAZL ALI J. -
JUDGE,PATANJALI SASTRI J. -
RPC,I agree that this application must fail. 
RPC,MAHAJAN J. I concur in the judgment which my brother Mukherjea is delivering and for the reasons given by him I allow the petition and quash the order of externment. 
RLC,"The order is for three months at present. -RLC,FACTS"
FACTS,Complaint was also made in the petition in respect of another and a subsequent order passed by the Government of Madhya Bharat which was served on the petitioner on his way to Nagpur and which 529 directed him to reside within the limits of the Nagpur Municipality and not to leave that area without the permission of the District Magistrate of that place.
FACTS,"This order of the Government of Madhya Bharat, we are told, has since been withdrawn and we are not concerned with that order or the Act under which it was passed in the present proceeding. "
ARG,The argument is that any order passed under such void legislative provisions must necessarily be void and of no effect in law. 
STATUTE,"The East Punjab Public Safety Act came into force on 29th March, 1949, and its object, as stated in the preamble, is to provide for special measures to ensure public safety and maintenance of public order. "
STATUTE,""" This right indeed is not absolute and the extent to which it could be curtailed by legislation is laid down in clause.(5)of article 19 which runs as follows: ""Nothing in sub clauses (d), (e) and (f) of the said clause shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it imposes, or prevent the State from making any law imposing, reasonable restrictions on the exercise of any of the rights conferred by the said sub clauses either in the interests of the general public or for the protection of the interests of any Scheduled Tribe."" Thus the primary question which requires consideration is, whether the impugned legislation which apparently seems to be in conflict with the fundamental right enunciated in article 19 (1) (d) of the Constitution is protected by clause (5) of the article, under which a law would be valid if it imposes reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right in the interests of the general public. "
REASONING,"If the Courts 'hold the restrictions imposed by the law to be reasonable, the petitioner would certainly have no remedy. "
REASONING,"If, on the other hand, they are held to be unreasonable, article 13 (1)of the Constitution imposes a duty upon the Court to pronounce the law to be invalid to the extent that it is inconsistent with the fundamental rights guaranteed under Part III of the Constitution. "
REASONING,"531 It has been urged, though somewhat faintly, by the learned Attorney General that the right of free movement throughout the Indian territory as enunciated in article 19 (1) (d) of the Constitution contemplates nothing else but absence of inter State restrictions, which might prevent citizens of the Indian Union from moving from one State to another. "
REASONING,"A law which does not impose barriers of this kind, it is said, cannot be inconsistent with the fundamental right secured by this clause."
REASONING,"Such a restricted interpretation is, in my opinion, not at all warranted by the language of the sub clause."
STATUTE,What article 19 (1) (d) of the Constitution guarantees is the free right of all citizens to go wherever they like in the Indian territory without any kind of restriction whatsoever. 
STATUTE,They can move not merely from one State to another but from one place to another within the same State and what the Constitution lays stress upon is that the entire Indian territory is one unit so far as the citizens are concerned.
STATUTE,"Clause (c) of section 4 (1) of the East Punjab Public Safety Act, 1949, authorizes the Provincial Government or the District Magistrate to direct any person to remove himself from any area and prohibit him from entering the same. "
REASONING,fundamental right guaranteed by article 19 (1) (d) of the Constitution. 
REASONING,"The controversy, therefore, narrows down to this, whether the impugned legislation is saved by reason of its being within the permissible limits prescribed by clause (5) of article 19."
STATUTE,"With regard to clause (5), the learned AttorneyGeneral points out at the outset that the word ""reasonable"" occurring in the clause qualifies ""restrictions"" and not ""law '"". "
ARG,"It is argued that in applying the clause, all that we have to see is whether the restrictions that are imposed upon the exercise of the right by law are reasonable or not and we have not to inquire into the reasonableness or otherwise of the law itself. "
ARG,"The reasonableness of the restrictions can be judged, ' according to the learned Attorney General, from the nature of the restrictions themselves and not from the manner in which or the authorities by which they are 532 imposed. "
REASONING,"I do agree that in clause (5) the adjective 'reasonable ' is predicated of the restrictions that are imposed by law and not of the law itself; but that does not mean that in deciding the reasonableness or otherwise of the restrictions, we have to confine ourselves to an examination of the restrictions in the abstract with reference merely to their duration or territorial extent, and that it is beyond our province to look up to the circumstances under which or the manner in which the restrictions have been imposed. "
REASONING,It is not possible to formulate an effective test which would enable us to pronounce any particular restriction to be reasonable or unreasonable per se. 
REASONING,All the attendant circumstances must be taken into consideration and one cannot dissociate the actual contents of the restrictions from the manner of their imposition or the mode of putting them into practice. 
REASONING,The question of reasonableness of the restrictions imposed by a law may arise as much from the substantive part of the law as from its procedural portion. 
RPC,"Thus, although I agree with the learned Attorney General that the word ""reasonable"" in clause (5) of article 19 goes with ""restrictions"" and not with ""law,"" I cannot accept his suggestion as regards the proper way of determining the reasonableness of the restrictions which a legislation might impose upon the exercise of the right of free movement. -"
REASONING,"Coming now to the provisions of the impugned Act, Mr. Baner jee 's main contention is that section 4 (1) (c)of the East Punjab Public Safety Act, which provides for passing of orders removing a person from a particular area, on the satisfaction of the Provincial Government or the District Magistrate, cannot be a reasonable piece of legislation inasmuch as the only prerequisite for imposition of the restrictions is the personal satisfaction of certain individuals or authorities, the propriety or reasonableness of which cannot be tested by the application of any external rule or standard. "
REASONING,"It is said that any law which places the liberty 533 of a subject at the mercy of an executive officer, however high placed he might be and whose action cannot be reviewed by a judicial tribunal, is an arbitrary and not a reasonable exercise of legislative powers. "
REASONING,The contention requires careful examination. 
REASONING,"It is not disputed that under clause (5) of article 19, the reasonableness of a challenged legislation has to be determined by a Court and the Court decides such matters by applying some objective standard which is said to be the standard of an average prudent man."
REASONING,"Judged by such standard which is sometimes described as an external yard stick, the vesting of authority in particular officers to take prompt action under emergent circumstances, entirely on their own responsibility or personal satisfaction, is not necessarily unreasonable."
REASONING,One has to take into account the whole scheme of the legislation and the circumstances under which the restrictive orders could be made.
STATUTE,The object of the East Punjab Public Safety Act is to provide for special measures to ensure public safety and maintenance of public order. 
STATUTE,"Under section 4 (1) (c) of the Act, the Provincial Government or the District Magistrate may make an order directing the removal of a certain person from a particular area, if they are satisfied that such order is necessary to prevent such person from acting in any way prejudicial to public safety or maintenance of public order. "
REASONING,"If emergent steps have got to be taken to prevent apprehended acts which are likely to jeopardize the interests or safety of the public, somebody must be given the power of taking the initial steps on his own responsibility; and no reasonable objection could be taken if the authority, who is given the power, is also entrusted with the responsibility of maintaining order and public peace in any particular district or province. "
STATUTE,"In my opinion, therefore, the provision of section 4 (1) (c) of the East Punjab Public Safety Act cannot be pronounced to be unreasonable, simply because the order could be passed by the Provincial Government 534 or the District Magistrate on their own personal satisfaction and not on materials which satisfy certain objective tests. -"
REASONING,"But though certain authorities can be invested with powers to make the initial orders on their own satisfaction in cases of this description, the position would certainly be different if the order thus made is allowed to continue for any indefinite period of time without giving the aggrieved person an opportunity to say what he has got to say against the order. "
REASONING,I have already set out the provisions of sub section (3) of section 4 which deals with the duration of the orders made under the various clauses of sub section (1). 
REASONING,It will be seen from this subsection that there is absolutely no limit as to the period of time during which an externment order would remain in force if the order is made by the Provincial Government. 
REASONING,The Provincial Government has been given unlimited authority in this respect and they can keep the order in force as long as they choose to do so. 
RPC,"As regards orders made by a District Magistrate, the period indeed has been fixed at three months, but even here the Provincial Government is competent to extend it to any length of time by means of a special order. "
RPC,"The law does not fix any maximum period beyond which the order cannot continue; and the fact that the Act itself would expire in August, 1951, is, in my opinion, not a relevant matter for consideration in this connection at all. "
RPC,I have no hesitation in holding that the provision of sub section (3) of section 4 is manifestly unreasonable and cannot be supported on any just ground. 
RPC,"One could understand that the exigencies of circumstances might justify the vesting of plenary powers on certain authorities which could pass orders on their ' own personal satisfaction temporarily and for a short period of time; but if these orders are to continue indefinitely, it is only fair that an opportunity should be given to the person against whom such order is made to say what he has to say in answer to the allegations made against him. "
RPC,There may not be an investigation by a regular Court but it is necessary that the aggrieved person should be given a fair hearing and that by an 535 impartial tribunal.
RPC,The grounds need not be communicated at all if the authorities so desire.
RPC,"As regards the right of representation the latter part of the sub section seems to imply that when the order is to remain in force for more than three months, the right of representation should be given to the aggrieved person and the representation shall be referred for consideration to the advisory tribunal constituted under section 3, subsection (4), of the Act. "
RPC,"The right, however, is purely illusory as would appear from the fact that even in cases where the order is to be operative for more than three months, there is no obligation on the part of the authorities to communicate to the person the grounds upon which the order was made."
RPC,"The aggrieved person consequently may not at all be apprised of the allegations made against him and it will be impossible for him to make any adequate or proper representation, if he is not told on what grounds the order was passed. "
RPC,"In my opinion, this is an equally unreasonable provision and neither sub section (3) nor sub section (6) of section 4 of the Act can be said to have imposed restrictions which are reasonable in the interests of the general public. "
RPC,"My conclusion, therefore, is that under article 13 (1) of the Indian Constitution, these provisions of the Act became void and inoperative after the Constitution came into 536 force, and consequently the order made by the District Magistrate in the present case cannot stand. "
RPC,"I would, therefore, allow the application and quash the externment order that has been passed against the petitioner."
RPC,Petition dismissed.

COUNSEL,"K. Bhimasankaran (Durga Bai, with him) for the appel lant."
COUNSEL,"R. Ganapathi Iyer, for the respondent."
JUDGE,The judgment of the Court was deliv ered by FAZL ALI J.
FACTS,"This appeal, which has been preferred after obtaining special leave to appeal from the Privy Council, is confined to the single question whether mens rea is neces sary to constitute an offence under section 81 of the De fence of India Rules."
FACTS,The facts of the case are briefly these.
FACTS,"The appellant is the licensee of two petrol filling stations Nos. 552 and 276 at Guntur but is a resident of Chirala, 40 miles away."
FACTS,He is a Presidency First Class Bench Magistrate at Chirala and manages what has been described as a vast business at several places.
FACTS,"Venkatarayudu and Dadda Pichayya, his employees, were respectively in charge of the aforesaid filling stations."
FACTS,"In 1946, the appellant and his two employ ees were tried before the Sub Divisional Magistrate of Guntur in respect of offences under the Motor Spirit Ration ing Order, 1941, and were convicted in each of the cases on the 18th July, 1946."
FACTS,"In the first case, the charges against the appellant and the employee in charge of the pump in question therein were that they on the 27th June, 1945, at Guntur, supplied petrol to a cars without taking coupons, in contravention of clause 22 read with clause 5 of the said Order promulgated under rule 81 (2) of the Defence of India Rules and that they, on the same day and at the same place, accepted coupons relating to two other cars in advance without supplying petrol, in contravention of clause 27 of the Order."
FACTS,"The charges in the second case were that the appellant and the employee in the second pump similarly supplied during the period of 24 hours from 6 a.m. of the 28th June, 1945, petrol to 4 motor vehicles 324 without taking coupons, in contravention of clause 22 read with clause 5, accepted coupons of three other vehicles in advance without issuing petrol, in contravention of clause 27, and supplied petrol to two other vehicles against cou pons but without making necessary endorsements and particu lars on the reverse of the coupons infringing thereby clause 27A of the said Order."
FACTS,"The Sub Divisional Magistrate, Guntur, found the appellant and the employee concerned in each case guilty of the charges brought against them and sentenced the appellant (with whose case alone we are now concerned) to a fine of Rs. 30 on the first count an d Rs. 20 on the second in the first case with simple imprisonment for one week in default, and to a fine of Rs. 20 on each of the three counts in the second case with one week 's impris onment in default."
FACTS,"The plea of the appellant before the Magistrate was that he was the presiding 1st Class Bench Magistrate at Chirala, that he was carrying on business in petrol at various centres through servants and he had issued instructions to them not to deviate from the rules under any circumstances and that he could not be made liable for transgression of the rules committed by his employees."
FACTS,The Magistrate however overruled the plea and convicted the appellant as stated above.
FACTS,"The appellant thereafter pre ferred an appeal to the Sessions Judge at Guntur, who, while setting aside the conviction of the appellant on the second count in each case, confirmed the conviction and sentence in respect of the other charges, on the 9th September, 1946."
FACTS,"This was confirmed in revision by the High Court at Madras on the 19th August, 1947."
FACTS,"Thereupon, the appellant applied to the Privy Council for special leave which was granted on the 9th July, 1948, limited to the single question whether mens rea is necessary to constitute an offence under rule 81 of the Defence of India Rules."
FACTS,The question to be decided in this appeal arises upon the plea taken by the appellant.
FACTS,", which has been already referred to, and the assumption on which the courts below have proceeded in dealing with the case."
FACTS,"The plea of the appellant that he was not present at 325 Guntur when the alleged offences were committed has not been negatived by the lower courts, but they have held that he was nevertheless liable, as the question of mens rea was not relevant to the offences with which the appellant was charged."
FACTS,"This view is set out very clearly in the following passage which may be quoted from the judgment of the trial Magistrate: ""It is argued on behalf of accused 1 that he is not a resident of Guntur and that he has no knowledge of any infringement committed by accused 2."
FACTS,"If any breach of the rules is committed by either proprietor or his servant, both are guilty whether they had the knowledge of the breach or not."
FACTS,"The question of mens rea will, of course, affect the measure of punishment but it cannot affect the conviction (vide ."
FACTS,""" Before deciding the question as to how far mens rea is material to conviction for the offences with which the appellant is charged, it is necessary to refer to the rele vant provisions of the Defence of India Rules and the Motor Spirit Rationing Order, 1941."
STATUTE,"Rule 81(2) of the Defence of India Rules empowers the Central or the Provincial Govern ment to provide by order, in certain circumstances, for regulating amongst other matters, distribution, disposal, use or consumption of articles or things and for requiring articles or things kept for sale to be sold either generally or to specified persons or classes of persons or in speci fied circumstances."
FACTS,"The Central Government in pursuance of the authority thus conferred made the Motor Spirit Ration ing Order, 1941, for ""securing the defence of British India, the efficient prosecution of the war and for maintaining supplies and services essential to the life of the communi ty."
STATUTE,""" Clause 2(d) of the Order defines ""dealer"" as meaning a supplier carrying on the business of supplying motor spirit as a retail business and includes a person having charge of a supply of motor spirit controlled by Government from which any person is furnished with motor spirit for private use."
STATUTE,"Sub clause (m) defines ""supplier"" as meaning a person carry ing on the business of supplying motor 326 spirit."
STATUTE,"Clause 5, which is the next relevant provision, runs thus : ""Motor spirit required for any vehicle not covered by clause 3 or clause 4 shall be furnished or acquired only against the surrender to a supplier at the time of supply of valid ordinary coupons or of a valid supplementary coupon and only in accordance with any conditions or instructions appearing on or attached to the coupons."
STATUTE,""" Clause 22 lays down: ""No person shall furnish or acquire a supply of motor spirit otherwise than in accordance with the provisions contained in this order."
STATUTE,"""Clause 27 is to the following effect:"" No person shall surrender to a supplier and no supplier shall accept special receipts or coupons at a time other than the time at which the supply of motor spirit authorised by the special receipts or coupons or acknowl edged by the receipts is furnished."" Clause 27A runs as follows : ""When motor spirit is furnished against the surrender of one or more coupons, the supplier shall immediately endorse, or cause to be endorsed, on each coupon so surren dered the registration or other identifying mark of the vehicle to which the motor spirit is furnished."
STATUTE,""" Rule 81(4)of the Defence of India Rules, which provides for the imposition of a penalty, says that ""if any person contravenes any order made under this rule, he shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years or with fine or both."
ARG,""" It is contended on behalf of the respondent that though ordinarily a person should not be held liable for the crimi nal acts of another and no person can be charged with the commission of an offence unless a particular."
ARG,intent or knowledge is found to be.
ARG,"present, mens tea is not of the essence of the offences with which we are concerned in this case and the appellant must be held liable for the acts of his employees."
PRECEDENT,The question raised in this appeal was con sidered by the Privy 327 Council in Srinivas Mall Bairolia vs King Emperor(1).
REASONING,"In that case, the appellants before the Privy Council were convicted under the Defence of India Rules relating to the control of prices and were sentenced to terms of imprison ment."
REASONING,The 1st appellant was acting as Salt Agent for part of the district of Darbhanga.
REASONING,"He had been appointed to this office by the District Magistrate, and it was his duty to sell to licensed retail dealers the supplies of salt which were allocated by the Central Government to his part of Dharbanga district."
REASONING,"The second appellant was employed by the first appellant and had been entrusted with the duty of allotting the appropriate quantity of salt to each retail dealer, and noting on the buyer 's licence the quantity which he had bought and received."
STATUTE,"By rule 81 (2) of the Defence of India Rules, the Provincial Governments were empowered to make orders to provide for controlling the prices at which articles or things of any description whatsoever might be sold."
REASONING,"The Defence of India Act, 1939, under which the rules were framed, empowered the Provincial Governments to dele gate the exercise of their powers to certain officers, and the power to provide by order for controlling the prices at which various articles (among them salt) might be sold, had been delegated to the District Magistrates."
REASONING,Rule 81 (4) of the Rules provided for the punishment of persons guilty of contravening any such orders.
REASONING,"Both the appellants were jointly charged with having sold salt on 3 days in July, 1943, to three named traders, in each case at a price ex ceeding the maximum price which had been fixed by order of the District Magistrate."
REASONING,"The 1st appellant was also sepa rately charged, in respect of the same sales, with having abetted the 2nd appellant 's contravention of the order."
REASONING,The trial Magistrate acquitted the 1st appellant of the substan tive offences but convicted him on the 3 charges of abet ting.
REASONING,The Sessions Judge and the High Court in revision confirmed the convictions.
REASONING,The Privy Council ultimately upheld the conviction of the appellants on the merits but with regard to the view taken by the High Court that even if the first appellant was (1) I.L.R. 26 Pat.
REASONING,"46. 328 not proved to have known of the unlawful acts of the second appellant, he was still liable on the ground that ' 'where there is an absolute prohibition and no question of mens rea arises, the master is criminally liable for the acts of the servant"", their Lordships observed as follows: ""With due respect to the High Court, their Lordships think it necessary to express their dissent from this view."
REASONING,They see no ground for saying that offences against those of the Defence of India Rules here in question are within the limited and exceptional class of offences which can be held to be committed without a guilty mind.
PRECEDENT,See the judgment of Wright J. in Sherras vs De Rutzen(1).
REASONING,"Offences which are within that class are usually of a comparatively minor character, and it would be a surprising result of this delegated legislation if a person who was morally inno cent of blame could be held vicariously liable for a serv ant 's crime and so punishable ' with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years. ' Their Lordships agree with the view which was recently expressed by the Lord Chief Justice of England, when he said: ' It is in my opinion of the utmost importance for the protection of the liberty of the subject that a court should always bear in mind that, unless the statute, either clearly or by necessary implica tion rules out mens rea as a constituent part of a crime, a defendant should not be found guilty of an offence against the criminal law unless he has got a guilty mind: Brend vs Wood(2) '"" In our opinion, the view of the law as propounded by the Privy Council is the correct view, and, applying it to the present case, it is difficult to hold the appellant guilty of the offence under clause 22 read with clause 5 of the Motor Spirit Rationing Order, 1941."
REASONING,The language of clause 22 does not lend support to the contention that even an innocent master will be criminally liable for an act of his servant.
REASONING,"This clause has already been quoted, but, to make the point clear, it may be stated that it provides that no person shall furnish . motor spirit otherwise than in accordance (1) , 921."
REASONING,"(2) (1946) 110 J.P. 317, 318 329 with the provisions contained in the Order."
REASONING,"The clause is not aimed specifically against a supplier, but is general in its language, and will hit the individual person, whether he be the supplier or not, who contravenes the provision."
REASONING,The language of the clause also suggests that only the person who furnishes motor spirit contrary to the provisions of the Order will be affected by the contravention.
PRECEDENT,"In the course of the arguments, reference was made on behalf of the appellant to the decision of the Bombay High Court in Isak Solomon Macmull vs Emperor(1) which is a case relating to the contravention of clause 22 of the Motor Spirit Rationing Order."
PRECEDENT,"In that case, the learned Chief Justice, who delivered the judgment, referred to the well established rule that unless a statute either clearly or by necessary implication rules out mens rea as a constituent part of a crime, the defendant should not be held guilty of an offence under the criminal law unless he has a guilty mind."
REASONING,"Relying upon this rule, he held that where a servant sells petrol to a bogus customer in the absence of coupons m contravention of the Motor Spirit Rationing Order, and the master is not present at the time nor has he any knowledge of the supply of petrol by the servants to the bogus custom er, the master cannot be held to be vicariously liable for the act of the servant."
REASONING,"In our opinion, this decision is correct and is directly applicable to the present case."
REASONING,"We have yet to deal with the third charge in the second case, which relates to the infringement of clause 27A of the Motor Spirit Rationing Order."
REASONING,"That clause, as already stat ed, makes it incumbent upon the supplier to endorse, or cause to be endorsed, the registration or other identifying mark of the vehicle to which the motor spirit is furnished."
REASONING,The substance of the charge on which the appellant has been convicted is that these particulars were not endorsed on several coupons against which petrol had been supplied.
REASONING,"Here again, the main contention put forward on behalf of the (1) A.I.R. 1948 Bom."
REASONING,"43 330 appellant was that the appellant cannot be held guilty inasmuch as the default in question was committed not by him personally, but by his servants."
REASONING,"Having regard to the language of the clause, however, this contention cannot be accepted."
REASONING,"Clause 27A, as we have already seen, throws the responsibility for making the necessary endorsement on the supplier."
REASONING,"The definition of the word 'supplier ' in the Act has already been quoted, and there can be no doubt that if clause 27A is contravened, a person who comes within the definition of the word 'supplier ' must be held guilty of the contravention."
REASONING,The object of this clause clearly is that the supplier of petrol should set up a complete machinery to ensure that the necessary endorsements are made on the coupons against which petrol is supplied.
REASONING,"It is conceivable that in many cases the default will be committed by the servants of the supplier, who are in charge of the petrol pump, but that fact by itself will not exonerate the suppli er from liability."
PRECEDENT,"In Mousell Brothers vs London and North Western Railway( '), Viscount Reading C.J., dealing with a case under the Railways Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, observed as follows : ""Prima facie, then, a master is not to be made criminal ly responsible for the acts of his servant to which the master is not a party."
REASONING,"But it may be the intention of the Legislature, in order to guard against the happening of the forbidden thing, to impose a liability upon a principal even though he does not know of, and is not party to, the forbid den act done by his servant."
REASONING,Many statutes are passed with this object.
REASONING,"Acts done by the servant of the licensed holder of licensed premises render the licensed holder in some instances liable, even though the act was done by his serv ant without the knowledge of the master."
REASONING,"Under the Food and Drugs Acts there are again instances well known in these Courts where the master is made responsible, even though he knows nothing of the act done by his servant, and he may be fined or rendered amenable to the penalty enjoined by the law."
REASONING,331 cases the Legislature absolutely forbids the act and makes the principal liable without a mens rea.
REASONING,""" In the same case, Atkin J. expressed the same view in these words : ""I think that the authorities cited by my Lord make it plain that while prima facie a principal is not to be made criminally responsible for the acts of his servants, yet the Legislature may prohibit an act or enforce a duty in such words as to make the prohibition or the duty absolute; in which case the principal is liable if the act is in fact done by his servants."
REASONING,"To ascertain whether a particular Act of Parliament has that effect or not regard must be had to the object of the statute, the words used, the nature of the duty laid down, the person upon whom it is imposed, the person by whom it would in ordinary circumstances be per formed, and the person upon whom the penalty is imposed."
REASONING,If authority for this is necessary it will be found in the judgment of Bowen L.J. in Reg.
PRECEDENT,"vs Tylor(1). ' ' In Mullins vs Collins(2), the servant of a licensed victualler having knowingly supplied liquor to a constable on duty without the authority of his superior officer, it was held that the licensed victualler was liable to be convicted although he had no knowledge of the act of his servant."
REASONING,"In dealing with the case, Blackburn J. observed thus: ""If we hold that there must be a personal knowledge in the licensed person, we should make the enactment of no effect."
REASONING,""" There are many other cases in England in which the same view has been enunciated, and some of them have been col lected and classified in the judgment of Wright J. in Sher ras vs De Rutzen(3), The principle laid down in these cases has been followed in several cases in this country also."
RPC,"In this view, the appeal is allowed in part, and while the conviction and sentence imposed on the (1) (3)[1895] IQB."
RPC,"(2) [1874] L.,R. 9 Q. B. 292 332 appellant on the first charge in both the cases are quashed, the conviction and sentence on the third charge in the second case are affirmed."

JUDGE,The judgment of the Court was deliv ered by KANIA C.J.
FACTS,This is an appeal by special leave against an order of the Allahabad High Court dismissing the revision petition of the appellant against the order of the Special Magistrate refusing to quash the proceedings on the ground that the prosecution of the appellant inter alia under sections 161 and 165 of 314 the Indian Penal Code was illegal and without jurisdiction in the absence of the sanction of the Government under section 107 of the Criminal Procedure Code and section 6 of the Prevention of Corruption.
FACTS,"Act (II of 1947), hereafter referred to as the Act."
FACTS,The material facts are these.
FACTS,"In 1947 the appellant held the office of Regional Deputy Iron and Steel Controller, Kanpur Circle, U.P., and was a public servant."
FACTS,"The police having suspected the appellant to be guilty of the offences mentioned above applied to the Deputy Magistrate, Kanpur, for a warrant of his arrest on the 22nd of October, 1947, and the warrant was issued on the next day."
FACTS,"The appellant was arrested on the 27th of October, 1947, but was granted bail."
FACTS,"On the 26th of November, 1947, the District Magistrate cancelled his bail as the Magistrate considered that the sureties were not proper."
FACTS,"On the 1st of December, 1947, the Government appointed a Special Magis trate to try offences under the Act and on the 1st December, 1947, the appellant was produced before the Special Magis trate and was granted bail."
FACTS,The police continued their investigation.
FACTS,"On the 6th of December, 1948, sanction was granted by the Provincial Government to prosecute the appel lant inter alia under sections 161 and 165 of of the Indian Penal Code."
FACTS,"On the 31st January, 1949, sanction in the same terms was granted by the Central Government."
FACTS,"In the meantime as a result of an appeal made by the appellant to the High Court of Allahabad the amount of his bail was reduced and on the 25th of March, 1949, the appellant was ordered to be put up before the Magistrate to answer the charge sheet submit ted by the prosecution."
ARG,"On behalf of the appellant it is argued that when the warrant for his arrest was issued by the Magistrate on the 22nd of October, 1947, the Magistrate took cognizance of the offence and, as no sanction of the Government had been obtained before that day, the initiation of the proceedings against him, which began on that day without the sanction of the Government, was illegal."
ARG,"It is argued that the same proceedings are continuing against him and therefore the notice to 315 appear before the Magistrate issued on 25th March, 1949, is also illegal."
FACTS,"In support of his contention that the Magis trate took cognizance of the offences on 22nd March, 1947, he relies principally on certain observations in Emperor vs Sourindra Mohan Chuckerbutty(1)."
FACTS,It is therefore necessary to determine when the Magis trate took cognizance of the offence.
STATUTE,The relevant part of section 190 of the Criminal Procedure Code runs as follows: 190.
STATUTE,"(1)""Except as hereinafter provided, any Presidency Magistrate, District Magistrate or Sub divisional Magistrate and any other Magistrate specially empowered in this behalf, may take cognizance of any offence (a) upon receiving a complaint of facts which constitute such offence; (b) upon a report in writing of such facts made by any police officer; (c) upon information received from any person other than a police officer, or upon his own knowledge or suspicion, that such offence has been committed. "" It is clear from the wording of the section that the initiation of the proceedings against a person commences on the cognizance of the offence by the Magistrate under one of the three contingencies mentioned in the section."
REASONING,The first contingency evidently is in respect of non cognizable of fences as defined in the Criminal Procedure Code on the complaint of an aggrieved person.
REASONING,"The second is on a police report, which evidently is the case of a cognizable offence when the police have completed their investigation and come to the Magistrate for the issue of a process."
REASONING,The third is when the Magistrate himself takes notice of an offence and issues the process.
REASONING,"It is important to remember that in respect of any cognizable offence, the police, at the initial stage when they are investigating the matter, can arrest a person without obtaining an (1) I.L.R. 41 316 order from the Magistrate."
STATUTE,"Under section 167(b) of the Criminal Procedure Code the police have of course to put up the person so arrested before a Magistrate within 24 hours and obtain an order of remand to police custody for the purpose of further investigation, if they so desire."
REASONING,But they have the power to arrest a person for the purpose of investigation without approaching the Magistrate first.
REASONING,Therefore in cases of cognizable offence before proceedings are initiated and while the matter is under investigation by the police the suspected person is liable to be arrested by the police without an order by the Magistrate.
REASONING,It may also be noticed that the Magistrate who makes the order of remand may be one who has no jurisdiction to try the case.
STATUTE,The posi tion however is materially altered because of section 3 of the Act which runs as follows: 3.
STATUTE,"""An offence punishable under section 161 or section 165 of the Indian Penal Code shall be deemed to be a cogniz able offence for the purposes of the Code of Criminal Proce dure, 1898, notwithstanding anything to the contrary con tained therein."
REASONING,Provided that a police officer below the rank of Deputy Superintendent of Police shall not investigate any such offence without the order of a Magistrate of the first class or make any arrest therefor without a warrant.
REASONING,""" It therefore follows that for the Prevention of Corrup tion Act, offences under sections 161 and 165 of the Indian Penal Code become cognizable, notwithstanding what is pro vided in the Criminal Procedure Code."
STATUTE,The proviso to sec tion 3 of the Act puts only two limitations on the powers of the police in connection with the investigation relating to those offences under the Act.
STATUTE,They are: (1) that the inves tigation 317 should be conducted by an officer not below the rank of a Deputy Superintendent of Police unless a Magistrate of the first class otherwise orders; and (2) if an arrest has to be made an order of the Magistrate has to be obtained.
REASONING,"The important point to be borne in mind is that the order of the Magistrate, which has to be obtained, is during the time the police is investigating the case and not when they have completed their investigation and are initiating the pro ceedings against the suspected person under section 190 of the Criminal Procedure Code."
REASONING,The order which may be applied for and made during the police investigation by virtue of section 3 of the Act is therefore before the Magistrate has taken cognizance of the offence under section 6 of the Act or section 190 of the Criminal Procedure Code.
REASONING,That appears to us to be the result of reading sections 3 and 6 of Act II of 1947 and section 190 of the Criminal Procedure Code read with the definition of cognizable offence in the Code.
STATUTE,"The argument of the appellant is that when the Magis trate issued the warrant in October, 1947, he did so on taking cognizance of the offence under section 161 or 165 of the Indian Penal Code under section 190 of the Criminal Procedure Code."
REASONING,It was contended that without such cogni zance the Magistrate had no jurisdiction to issue any proc ess as that was the only section which permitted the Magis trate to issue a process against a person suspected of having committed an offence.
STATUTE,In our opinion having regard to the wording of section 3 of the Act the assumption that the Magistrate can issue a warrant only after taking cogni zance of an offence under section 190 of the Criminal Procedure Code is unsound.
STATUTE,The proviso to section 3 of the Act expressly covers the case of a Magistrate issuing a warrant for the arrest of a person in the course of investi gation only and on the footing that it is a cognizable offence.
STATUTE,Section 3 of the Act which makes an offence under section 161 or 165 of the Indian Penal Code cognizable has provided the two safeguards as the proceedings are contem plated against a public servant.
STATUTE,"But because of these safe guards it 318 does not follow that the warrant issued by the Magistrate under section 3 of the Act is after cognizance of the of fence, and not during the course of investigation by the police in respect of a cognizable offence."
REASONING,The only effect of that proviso is that instead of the police officer ar resting on his own motion he has got to obtain an order of the Magistrate for the arrest.
REASONING,"In our opinion, it is wrong from this feature of section 3 of the Act alone to contend that because the warrant is issued it must be after the Magistrate has taken cognizance of it and the Magistrate 's action can be only under section 190 of the Criminal Proce dure Code."
STATUTE,"The material part of section 197 of the Criminal Procedure Code provides that where any public servant who is not removable from his office save with the sanction of Government is accused of an offence alleged to have been committed by him while acting or purporting to act in the discharge of his official duty, no court shall take cogni zance of such offence except with the previous sanction of the appropriate Government."
STATUTE,This section read as following section 190 shows that the word 'cognizance ' in this section indicates the stage of initiation of proceedings against a public servant.
STATUTE,"Sections 190 to 199 B of the Criminal Proce dure Code are grouped together under the caption ""Initiation of proceedings""."
STATUTE,The sections dealing with the stage of in vestigation by the police in the case of cognizable offences are quite different.
STATUTE,Under section 6 of the Act it is pro vided that no court shall take cognizance of an offence punishable under section 161 or 165 of the Indian Penal Code . alleged to have been committed by a public servant except with the previous sanction of the appropriate Government.
STATUTE,"Reading sections 197 and 190 of the Criminal Procedure Code and section 6 of the Act in the light of the wording of the proviso to section a, it is therefore clear that the stage at which a warrant is asked for under the proviso to section 3 of the Act is not on cognizance of the offence by the Magistrate as contemplated by the other three sections."
PRECEDENT,"319 Learned counsel for the appellant relied on some observa tions in Emperor vs Sourindra Mohan Chuckerbutty (1), in respect of the interpretation of the word 'cognizance '."
REASONING,"In that case, on the 24th April, 1909, a dacoity took place at N and on the same day the police sent up a report of the occurrence to the Sub divisional officer of Diamond Harbour."
REASONING,On the 2nd September one of the accused was arrested and he made a confession on the 18th October.
REASONING,"The case was subse quently transferred by the District Magistrate of Alipore to his own file and on the 20th January, 1910, an order under section 2 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act (XIV of 1908) was issued in the following terms: ""Whereas the District Magistrate of the 24 Parganas has taken cognizance of offences under sections 395 and 397, I.P.C., alleged to have been committed by the persons accused in the case of Emperor vs Lalit Mohan Chuckerbutty and others . and whereas it appears to the Lieutenant Governor of Bengal. the provi sions of Part 1 of the Indian Criminal Law Amendment Act should be made to apply to the proceedings in respect of the said offences, now, therefore, the Lieutenant Governor. directs. that the provisions of the said Part shall apply to the said case."
REASONING,""" S surrendered on the 24th of January and was arrested by the police and put before the Joint Magis trate of Alipore who remanded him to Jail."
REASONING,Applications for bail on his behalf were made but they were dismissed.
REASONING,The Sessions Judge was next moved unsuccessfully for bail under section 498 of the Criminal Procedure Code.
REASONING,S then moved the High Court for a Rule calling upon the District Magistrate to show cause why bail should not be granted on the grounds (1) that no order had been made applying Act XIV of 1908 and (2) that there did not appear any sufficient cause for further inquiry into the guilt of section The first contention rested on the assertion that the Magistrate had not taken cognizance of the offence of dacoity on the 20th of January.
REASONING,The learned Judges pointed out that the argument was ad vanced because the legal adviser of S had (1) 1. 320 SUPREME COURT REPORTS no opportunity to see the record of the case.
REASONING,On the facts it was clear that the Magistrate had taken cognizance of the offence on the 20th of January.
REASONING,"The observations ""taking cognizance does not involve any formal action or indeed action of any kind but occurs as soon as a. magistrate as such applies his mind to the suspected commission of an offence"" have to be read in the light of these facts."
REASONING,"As noticed above, the magistrate had expressly recorded that he had taken cognizance of the case and thereupon the provi sions of the Criminal Law Amendment Act were made applicable to the case."
REASONING,The question argued before the High Court was in respect of the power of the High Court to grant bail after the provisions of the Criminal Law Amendment Act were applied to the case.
REASONING,In our opinion therefore that decision and the observations therein do not help the appellant.
PRECEDENT,"In Gopal Marwari vs Emperor (1), it was observed that the word 'cognizance 'is used in the Code to indicate the point when the Magistrate or a Judge first takes judicial notice of an offence."
REASONING,it is a different thing from the initiation of proceedings.
REASONING,It is the condition precedent to the initiation of proceedings by the Magistrate.
REASONING,The court noticed that the word 'cognizance 'is a word of somewhat indefinite import and it is perhaps not always used in exactly the same sense.
PRECEDENT,"After referring to the observations in Emperor vs Sou rindra Mohan Chuckerbutty (2), it was stated by Das Gupta J. in Superintendent and Remembrancer of Legal Affairs, West Bengal vs Abani Kumar Banerjee (3) as follows : "" What is taking cognizance has not been defined in the Criminal Procedure Code and I have no desire to attempt to define it."
REASONING,"It seems to me clear however that before it can be said that any magistrate has taken cognizance of any offence under section 190 (1) (a), Criminal Procedure Code, he must not only have applied his mind to the contents of the petition but he must have done so for the purpose (1) A.I.R. 1943 Pat."
REASONING,(2) I. L. R. 321 of proceeding in a particular way as indicated in the subse quent provisions of this Chapter proceeding under section 200 and thereafter sending it for inquiry and report under section 202.
REASONING,"When the magistrate applies his mind not for the purpose of proceeding under the subsequent sections of this Chapter, but for taking action of some other kind, e.g., ordering investigation under section 156 (3), or issuing a search warrant for the purpose of the investiga tion, he cannot be said to have taken cognizance of the offence."
REASONING,""" In our opinion that is the correct approach to the question before the court."
REASONING,"Moreover, in the present case on the 25th March, 1949, the Magistrate issued a notice under section 190 of the Criminal Procedure Code against the appellant and made it returnable on the 2nd of May, 1949."
REASONING,That clearly shows that the Magistrate took cognizance of the offence only on that day and acted under section 190 of the Criminal Procedure Code.
REASONING,On the returnable date the appellant contended that the sanction of the Central Government was void because it was not given by the Government of the State.
REASONING,On the deci sion going against him he appealed to the High Court and to the Privy Council.
REASONING,"The appellant 's contention having thus failed, the Magistrate proceeded with the trial on the 26th of November, 1949."
REASONING,"The only question which is now presented for our decision therefore is whether there was any sanction granted by the Government before the Magistrate took cogni zance of the offence and issued the notice under section 190 of the Criminal Procedure Code On the 25th March, 1949."
REASONING,To that the clear answer is that the Government had given its sanction for the prosecution of the appellant before that date.
RPC,It seems to us therefore that the appellant 's conten tion that the Magistrate had to take cognizance of the offences without the previous sanction of the Government is untenable and the appeal fails.
RPC,Appeal dismissed.
NAME,"Logendranath Jha & Others vs Shri Polailal Biswas on 24 May, 1951"
CITATION,"Equivalent citations: 1951 AIR 316, 1951 SCR 676"
JUDGE,1951 May 24. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by PATANJALI SASTRI J.
FACTS,"This is an appeal by special leave from an order of the High Court of Judicature at Patna setting aside an order of acquittal of the appellants by the Sessions Judge, Purnea, and directing their retrial."
FACTS,"The appellants were prosecuted for alleged offences under sections 147, 148, 323, 324, 326, 302 and 302/149 of the Indian Penal Code at the instance of one Polai Lal Biswas who lodged a complaint against them before the po lice."
FACTS,"The prosecution case was that, while the complainant was harvesting the paddy crop on his field at about 10 a.m. on 29th November, 1949, a mob of about fifty persons came on to the field armed with ballams, lathis and other weapons and that the first appellant Logendranath Jha, who was leading the mob, demanded a settlement of all outstanding disputes with the complainant and ,said he would not allow the paddy to be removed unless the disputes were settled."
FACTS,An altercation followed as a result of which Logendra or dered an assault by his men.
FACTS,"Then Logendra and one of his men, Harihar, gave ballam blows to one of the labourers, Kangali, who fell down and died on the spot."
FACTS,Information was given to the police who investigated the case and submitted the charge sheet.
RLC,The committing Magistrate found that a prima facie case was made out and committed the appellants to the Court of Sessions for trial.
ARG,"The appellants pleaded not guilty alleging inter alia, that Mohender and Debender, the brothers of Logendra (appel lants 2 and 3) were not present in the village of Dandkhora with which they had no concern, as all the lands in that village had been allotted to Logendra at a previous parti tion, that Logendra himself was not in the village at the time of the occurrence but arrived 678 soon after and was dragged to the place at the instance of his enemies in the village and was placed under arrest by the Assistant Sub Inspector of Police who had arrived there previously."
FACTS,"It was also alleged that there were two factions in the village, one of which was led by one Harimohan, a relation of the complainant, and the other by Logendra and there had been numerous revenue and criminal proceedings and long standing enmity between the families of these leaders as a result of which this false case was foisted upon the appellants."
RLC,The learned Sessions Judge examined the evidence in great detail and found that the existence of factions as alleged by the appellants was true.
FACTS,"He found, however, that the appellants ' plea of alibi was not satisfactorily made out, ""but the truth of the prosecution"", he proceeded to observe, ""cannot be judged by the falsehood of the defence nor can the prosecution derive its strength from the weak ness of the defence."
REASONING,Prosecution must stand on its own legs and must prove the story told by it at the very first stage.
REASONING,"The manner of occurrence alleged by the prosecution must be established beyond doubt before the accused persons can be convicted""."
REASONING,"Approaching the case in this manner and seeing that the basis of the prosecution case was that Polai had batai settlement of the disputed land and had raised the paddy crop which he was harvesting when the occurrence took place, the learned Sessions Judge examined the evidence of the prosecution witnesses who belonged to the opposite faction critically and found that the story of the prosecu tion was not acceptable."
REASONING,"Polai, who was alleged to have taken the land on batai settlement from his own maternal grandmother Parasmani who brought him up from his childhood, was only 19 years old and unmarried and was still living with his grandmother."
REASONING,He did not claim to be a bataidar of any other person.
REASONING,"""In these circumstances"", said the learned Judge, ""it does not appear to me to be probable that Polai would have been allowed to maintain himself by running adhi cultivation of his mamu 's land in the lifetime of 679 his nani who has brought him up from his infancy like her own child."
REASONING,"Nor does it appeal to me that the unmarried boy Polai would have undertaken upon himself the task of run ning batai cultivation of the lands of his mamu where he has been living since his childhood without any trouble, more particularly in view of the heavy expenses of cultivation brought out by the evidence of Tirthanand (P.W. 14)""."
REASONING,"He, therefore, disbelieved the whole story that Polai had taken the lands of his grandmother or his uncles as bataidar for cultivation and that he was engaged in harvesting the paddy crop on the lands at the time of the occurrence."
REASONING,"This false story, in his opinion, ""vitally affected the prosecution case regarding the alleged manner of the occurrence""."
REASONING,"He also found a number of discrepancies and contradictions in the evidence of the prosecution witnesses, which, in his view, tended to show that the prosecution was guilty of concealment of the real facts. ' 'In view of such conceal ment of real facts,"" the learned Judge concluded, ""it does not appear to me to be possible to apportion liability and to decide which of the two parties commenced the fight and which acted in self defence."
REASONING,"Such being the position, it is not possible at all to hold either party responsible for what took place."
REASONING,"In such a view of the matter coupled with the fact that the manner of occurrence alleged by the prose cution has not been established to be true beyond doubt, I think that the accused persons cannot be safely convicted of any of the offences for which they have been charged."
RLC,""" The learned Judge accordingly acquitted the appellants of all the charges framed against them."
FACTS,"Against that order the complainant Polai preferred a revision petition to the High Court under section 439 of the Criminal Procedure Code., The learned Judge who heard the petition reviewed the evidence at some length and came to the conclusion that the judgment of the learned Sessions Judge could not be allowed to stand as the acquittal of the appellants was ""perverse ' '."
FACTS,"In his opinion, ""the entire judgment displays a lack 680 of true perspective in a case of this kind."
RLC,"The Sessions Judge had completely misdirected himself in looking to the minor discrepancies in the case and ignoring the essential matters so far as the case is concerned,"" and there was no justifiable ground for rejecting the prosecution evidence regarding the cultivation and harvesting by Polai."
RLC,"And he concluded with the warning ""I would, however, make it per fectly clear that when the case is re tried, which I am now going to order, the Judge proceeding with the trial will not be in the least influenced by any expression of opinion which I may have given in this judgment."
ARG,""" On behalf of the appellants Mr. Sinha raised two conten tions."
ARG,"In the first place, he submitted that having regard to section 417 of the Criminal Procedure Code which provides for an appeal to the High Court from an order of acquittal only at the instance of the Government, a revision petition under section 439 at the instance of a private party was incompetent, and, secondly, that sub section (4) of section 439 clearly showed that the High Court exceeded its powers of revision in the present case in upsetting the findings of fact of the trial Judge. ' We think it is unnecessary to express any opinion on the first contention of Mr. Sinha especially as the respondent is unrepresented, as we are of opinion that his second and alternative contention must prevail."
REASONING,It will be seen from the judgment summarised above that the learned Judge in the High Court re appraised the evi dence in the case and disagreed with the Sessions Judge 's findings of fact on the ground that they were perverse and displayed a lack of true perspective.
REASONING,"He went further and, by way of ""expressing in very clear terms as to how perverse the judgment of the court below is"", he indicated that the discrepancies in the prosecution evidence and the circum stances of the case which led the Sessions Judge to discred it the prosecution story afforded no justifiable ground for the conclusion that the prosecution failed to establish their case."
REASONING,We are of opinion that the learned Judge in the High Court did not properly appreciate the 681 scope of inquiry in revision against an order of acquittal.
REASONING,"Though sub section(1) of section 439 authorises the High Court to exercise, in its discretion, any of the powers conferred on a court of appeal by section 423, sub section (4) specifically excludes the power to ""convert a finding of acquittal into one."
REASONING,"of conviction""."
REASONING,"This does not mean that in dealing with a revision petition by a private party against an order of acquittal, the High Court could in the absence of any error on a point of law re appraise the evidence and reverse the findings of facts on which the acquittal was based, provided only it stopped short of finding the accused guilty and passing sentence on him."
REASONING,"By merely characterising the judgment of the trial Court as ""perverse"" and ' lacking in perspective"", the High Court cannot reverse pure findings of fact based on the trial Court 's appreciation of the evidence in the case."
REASONING,"That is what the learned Judge in the court below has done, but could not, in our opinion, properly do on an application in revision filed by a private party against acquittal."
REASONING,"No doubt, the learned Judge formally complied with sub section (4) by directing only a retrial of the appellants without convicting them, and warned that the court retrying the case should not be influenced by any expression of opinion con tained in his judgment."
REASONING,"But there can be little doubt that he loaded the dice against the appellants, and it might prove difficult for any subordinate judicial officer dealing with the case to put aside altogether the strong views expressed in the judgment as to the credibility of the prosecution witnesses and the circumstances of the case in general."
REASONING,"We are of opinion that the learned Judge in the High Court exceeded his powers of revision in dealing with the case in the manner he did, and we set aside his order for retrial of the appellants and restore the order of acquittal passed by the Sessions Judge."
RPC,Appeal allowed.
NAME,"Manohar Lal vs The State on 23 May, 1951"
CITATION,"Equivalent citations: 1951 AIR 315, 1951 SCR 671"
COUNSEL,Kundan Lal Arora for the appellant.
COUNSEL,S.N. Chopra for the respondent.
JUDGE,The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Bose J.
FACTS,"This is a criminal appeal against a convic tion under section 16 of the Punjab Trade Employees Act, 1940, as amended in 1943, read with section 7(1)."
FACTS,The appellant is a shopkeeper who owns and runs a shop in the Cantonment Area of Ferozepore.
FACTS,"He has no ""employees"" within the meaning of the Act but is assisted by his son in running the shop."
FACTS,The shop is 673 divided into two sections.
FACTS,"In one, articles of haberdashery are sold; in the other, articles of stationery."
STATUTE,"Section 7(1) of the Act as amended requires that ""Save as otherwise provided by this Act, every shop . shall remain closed on a close day."
STATUTE,""" Sub section (2)(i) states that The choice of a close day shall rest with the owner or occupier of a shop . and shall be intimated to the prescribed authority within etc."
FACTS,""" The appellant made the following choice."
FACTS,He elected to close the haberdashery section on Mondays and the stationery section on Saturdays and gave the necessary intimation to the prescribed authority to that effect.
FACTS,"On Monday, the 17th of May, 1948, the appellant 's son sold a tin of boot polish to a customer from the haberdash ery, section of the shop."
FACTS,The appellant was present in person at the time of the sale.
FACTS,Monday was a close day for the haberdashery section and so the appellant was prosecuted under section 16 read with section 7.
RLC,The trying Magistrate held that in selling the article of haberdashery on a close day and in not observing Monday as a close day the appellant had infringed the provisions of section 7(1) of the Act.
RLC,He accordingly convicted him and imposed a fine of Rs. 20.
FACTS,A revision application to the High Court failed.
RLC,"The High Court held that as the appellant had failed to keep his shop closed one day in the week, his conviction was proper."
FACTS,"A certificate for leave to appeal to this Court, on the ground that a substantial question of law relating to the Govern ment of India Act, 1935, was involved, was granted and that is how we come to be seized of the matter."
ARG,"The learned counsel for the appellant contended that section 7 of the Act is ultra vires in that it does not fall under any of the items in either the Provincial or the Concurrent Legislative Lists in the Government of India Act, 1935."
REASONING,"In our opinion, the matter can come either under item No. 27 in List II or item No. 27 in List III."
REASONING,"674 Item No. 27 in List II covers ""trade and commerce within the Province."
REASONING,""" In our opinion, a Provincial Government could, under that entry, regulate the hours, place, date and manner of sale of any particular commodity or commodities."
REASONING,"It could, for example, state that the sale of explosives or other dangerous substances should only be in selected areas, at specified times or on specified days when extra precau tions for the general safety of the public and those direct ly concerned could be arranged for."
REASONING,That would appear to be obvious.
REASONING,"In the same way, it could, if it so pleased, say that there shall be no sales on a particular day, say a Sunday or a Friday, or on days of religious festivals and so forth."
REASONING,"Instead of doing that, it has chosen to regulate the internal trade of the Province in this manner which is only one of the various ways in which it could have acted."
REASONING,"The matter can also be brought under item 27 in List III: ""welfare of labour; conditions of labour."
REASONING,""" The im pugned section is a general one and applies to all kinds of shops; that is to say, to those in which labour is employed as well as to those which are run by the owners and their families."
REASONING,The Act in which the section occurs is directed at regulating the hours of employment of persons who are employed in the business of shops or commercial establish ments.
REASONING,"Therefore, in so far as section 7 covers establish ments where labour is employed, it is undoubtedly intra vires."
REASONING,But it was argued that the section can have no appli cation to shops which an owner runs with or without the assistance of his family.
STATUTE,"Reliance for this was placed on section 2 A (i) and (j) which is as follows: ""2 A. Nothing in this Act shall apply to (i) persons employed in a managerial capacity . and (j) the members of the family of the employer."
REASONING,""" It was argued that the sale was by the son."
REASONING,He is not affected by the Act.
REASONING,he was entitled to sell and he could not sell unless the shop was kept 675 open to enable him to do so.
REASONING,"So also as regards the appel lant, the owner, who was there in a managerial capacity."
REASONING,"In our opinion, this is fallacious because the conviction here is not for the sale but for keeping the shop open on a close day."
STATUTE,"Section 2 A (j) does not give the son a right to keep the shop open or, for that matter, a right to sell."
REASONING,"All it says is that he, being a member of the family, shall not be affected by the provisions of the Act."
STATUTE,"Section 7(1), on the other hand, is directed against the owner of the shop, not against his family."
REASONING,It compels the owner to keep his shop closed one day in a week.
REASONING,"It was then contended that if a person employed in a managerial capacity cannot be affected by the Act, then the appellant who was there in that capacity cannot be compelled to close the shop under section 7."
REASONING,This is also fallacious.
REASONING,It happens in the present case that the owner and the manag er are the same but the Act obviously makes provision for a class of case in which they are different.
REASONING,"The owner is obliged to close the shop one day in a week, though the manager of the shop can work without, for example, having the twenty four consecutive hours of rest every week which section 7 A enjoins."
REASONING,The appellant 's capacity as manager will have to be separated from his character as owner for this purpose.
STATUTE,Section 2 A(i) does not control section 7 (1).
REASONING,"Lastly, it was argued that the scheme of the Act makes it plain that it is for ameliorating the conditions of labour employed in shops."
REASONING,"It cannot therefore apply to shops in which no labour is employed, particularly when the family of the ""employer"" is expressly excluded from the purview of the Act."
REASONING,"For this reason also, it cannot fall under item 27 in List III."
REASONING,We are of opinion that such a narrow interpre tation cannot be placed upon the entry.
REASONING,"The legislature may have felt it necessary, in order to reduce the possibilities of evasion to a minimum, to encroach upon the liberties of those who would not otherwise have been affected."
REASONING,That we think it had power to do.
REASONING,"Further, to require a shopkeeper, who employs one or two men, to close and 676 permit his rival, who employs perhaps a dozen members of his family, to remain open, clearly places the former at a grave commercial disadvantage."
REASONING,To permit such a distinction might well engender discontent and in the end react upon the relations between employer and employed.
REASONING,All these are matters of policy into which we cannot enter but which serve to justify a wide and liberal interpretation of words and phrases in these entries.
RPC,The appeal fails and is dismissed.
RPC,Appeal dismissed.
NAME,"COMMISSIONER OF EXCESS PROFITS TAX,BOMBAY CITY vs Sri Lakshmi Silk Mills Ltd on 18 September, 1951"
CITATION,"Equivalent citations: 1951 AIR 454, 1952 SCR 1"
COUNSEL,"M.C. Setalvad, Attorney General for India (Gopal Singh, with him) for the appellant."
COUNSEL,"N.C. Chatterjee (B. Sen, with him)for the respondent. 1951."
JUDGE,The Judgment of the Court was deliv ered by MAHAJAN J.
FACTS,"The sole controversy in this appeal centres round the point as to whether or not excess profits tax is payable on the sum of Rs. 20,005 received by the respondent from Messrs Parakh & Co. by way of rent for the dyeing plant let out to them during the chargeable accounting period."
FACTS,"The respondent (Sri Lakshmi Silk Mills Ltd.) is a manu facturer of silk cloth, and as a part of its business it installed a plant for dyeing silk yarn."
FACTS,"During the charge able accounting period (1st January, 1943, to 31st December, 1943) owing to difficulty in obtaining silk yarn on account of the war it could make no use of this plant and it re mained idle for some time."
FACTS,"On the 20th August, 1943, it was let out to Messrs E. Parakh & Co. on a rent of Rs. 4,001 per month."
FACTS,"The Excess Profits Tax Officer by his assessment order dated 11th June, 1945, included the sum of Rs. 20,005 realized as rent for five months, in the profits of the business of the respondent and held that excess profits tax was payable on this amount."
FACTS,This order was confirmed on appeal by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and on fur ther appeal by the Income tax Tribunal.
RLC,"The Tribunal, however, on being asked referred the following question of law to the High Court for its opinion: ""Whether in the circumstances of the case, the asses see 's income of Rs. 20,005 is profits from business 3 within the meaning of section 2 (5) of the Excess Profits Tax Act and therefore or otherwise liable to pay excess profits tax ?"" The High Court answered the question in the negative."
FACTS,This is an appeal by special leave from this decision.
FACTS,"It was contended on behalf of the Commissioner before the High Court that the dyeing plant was a commercial asset of the assessee 's business for the purpose of earning profit and if this commercial asset yielded income to him in any particular manner, it was income from the assessee 's busi ness for the purpose of the Excess Profits Tax Act."
FACTS,It was said that it was immaterial whether a commercial asset yields income by use of the assessee himself or its being used by someone else.
FACTS,"This contention was disposed of by the learned Chief Justice in these words : ""Mr. Joshi seems to be right but with this qualification that the commercial asset must be at the time it was let out in a condition to be used as a commercial asset by the assessee."
FACTS,"If it has ceased to be a commercial asset, if its use as a commercial asset has been discontinued, then if the assessee lets it out, he is not putting to use something which is a commercial asset at the time."
RLC,"""Now, on the facts found by the Tribunal, it is clear that when the assessee let out this dyeing plant, it had remained idle for some time."
FACTS,He could not obtain silk yarn on account of the war and therefore it was not possible to make use of it as a commercial asset as far as the assessee himself was concerned and it was only for that reason that he let it out to Messrs E. Parakh & Co. I can understand the principle for which Mr. Joshi is contending that it makes no difference what an assessee does with a commercial asset belonging to him.
FACTS,He may use it as he likes.
FACTS,So long as it yields income it is the income of his business.
REASONING,"Var ious cases have been cited at the Bar and I think that those cases though apparently conflicting are reconcilable if we accept this principle to be the correct principle 4 and apply this ratio as the ratio emerging from these cases and I will state the principle and the ratio again that if an assessee derives income from a commercial asset which is capable at the time of being used as a commercial asset, then it is income from his business, whether he uses that commercial asset himself or lets it out to somebody else to be used."
REASONING,"But if the commercial asset is not capable of being used as such, then its being let out does not result in an income which is the income of the business."" Mr. Justice Tendolkar concurred in this view and ob served as follows : ""The ratio of all these cases to my mind is that if there is a commercial asset which is capable of being worked by the assessee himself for the purpose of earning profits and the assessee instead of doing so, either voluntarily allows someone else to use it on payment of a certain sum or is compelled by law to allow it to be used in such manner, then what he receives is income from business."
REASONING,"But if the commercial asset has ceased to be a commercial asset in the hands of the assessee and thereafter he gets what he can out of it by letting it out to be used by others, then the rent he receives is not income from any business that he carries on."
ARG,""" The learned Attorney General pointed out that the nature of a commercial asset is not changed because a par ticular person is unable to use it."
ARG,The inability of the assessee to make use of it in certain circumstances does not in any way ' affect the nature of the asset and cause an infirmity in the asset itself.
ARG,"It was contended that when the dyeing plant became idle for a short time during the chargeable accounting period it did not cease to be a com mercial asset of the respondent for it had no other busi ness; that all the assets of the respondent including the dyeing plant were the assets of the business, that whatever income was derived by the use of these assets including the income that an asset fetched by its being let out was the business income of the assessee, and that there was no warrant 5 in law for the proposition that a commercial asset which yields income must be used as an asset by the respondent himself before its income becomes chargeable to tax."
ARG,The learned counsel for the respondent urged that as soon as the assessee found difficulty in obtaining yarn the dyeing plant became redundant for its business and ceased to be an asset of its business and any income derived from the rent by letting out this asset was income received by the assessee from other sources and therefore was not charge able to excess profits tax.
REASONING,"In our opinion, the contention raised by the learned Attorney General is sound."
REASONING,"The High Court was in error in engrafting a proviso on the rule deduced by it from the authorities considered by it, to the effect that a commer cial asset of a business concern which yields income must at the time it was let out be in a condition to be used as a commercial asset by the assessee himself."
REASONING,"We respectfully concur in the opinion of the learned Chief Justice that if the commercial asset is not capable of being used as such, then its being let out to others does not result in an income which is the income of the business, but we cannot accept the view that an asset which was acquired and used for the purpose of the business ceased to be a commercial asset of that business as soon as it was temporarily put out of use or let out to another person for use in his business or trade."
REASONING,The yield of income by a commercial asset is the profit of the business irrespective of the manner in which.
REASONING,that asset is exploited by the owner of the business.
REASONING,He is entitled to exploit it to his best advantage and he may do so either by using it himself personally or by letting it out to somebody else.
REASONING,"Suppose, for instance, in a manufac turing concern the use of its plant and machinery can advan tageously be made owing to paucity of raw materials only for six hours in a working day, and in order to get the best yield out of it, another person who has got the requisite raw materials is allowed to use it as a licensee on payment of certain 6 consideration for three hours; can it be said in such a situation with any justification that ' the amount realized from the licensee is not a part of the business income of the licensor."
REASONING,In this case the company was incorporated purely as a manufacturing concern with the object of making profit.
REASONING,"It installed plant and machinery for the purpose of its business, and it was open to it if at any time it found that any part of its plant ""for the time being"" could not be advantageously employed for earning profit by the company itself, to earn profit by leasing it to somebody else."
REASONING,It is difficult to hold that the income thus earned by the commer cial asset is not income from the business of the company that has been solely incorporated for the purpose of doing business and earning profits.
REASONING,There is no material whatever for taking the view that the assessee company was incorpo rated with any other object than of carrying on business or trade.
REASONING,"Owning properties and letting them was not a purpose for which it was formed and that being so, the disputed income cannot be said to fall under any section of the Indian Income tax Act other than section 10."
REASONING,Cases of undertakings of this nature stand on an entirely different footing and are distinguishable from cases of individuals or companies acquiring lands or buildings and making income by letting them on hire.
REASONING,"These latter cases may legitimately fall under the specific provisions of section 9 or section 12, though the High Courts in this country are by no means unanimous on this subject; but for the purpose of this case it is unnecessary to resolve that conflict."
REASONING,"It may be observed that no general principle can be laid down which is applicable to all cases, and each case has to be decided on its own circumstances."
REASONING,"Decisions of the Eng lish courts given under the Finance Acts, the scheme of which is different from the Indian Income tax statutes, are not always very helpful in dealing with matters arising under the Indian law and analogies and inferences drawn from those decisions are at times misleading."
PRECEDENT,"We, however, are in respectful agreement with the observations of Lord 7 President Strathclyde in Sutherland vs The Commissioners of Inland Revenue(1) that if a commercial asset is susceptible of being put to a variety of different uses in which gain might be acquired, whichever of these uses it was put to by the appellant, the profit earned was a user of the asset of the same business."
REASONING,A mere substituted use of the commercial asset does not change or alter the nature of that asset.
REASONING,"Whatever the commercial asset produces is income of the business of which it is an asset, the process by which the asset makes the income being immaterial."
REASONING,"Mr. Chatterjee for the respondent stressed the point that as the dyeing plant in the present case could not be made use of by the assessee in its manufacturing business owing to the non availability of yarn, it ceased to be a commercial asset of the business of the assessee and became redundant to that business and that being so, any income earned by this asset which had ceased to be a commercial asset was not an income of the business but must be held to have been derived from a source other than business and fell within the ambit of section 12 of the Indian Income tax Act, and on this income excess profits tax was not payable."
PRECEDENT,He contended that the facts of this case were analogous to the case of Inland Revenue Commissioners vs lies(2) and it should be similarly decided.
REASONING,In that case the taxpayer carried on the business of sand and gravel merchant on certain land and at the same time he granted licences to three firms to enter his land and win gravel for themselves in return for which he received from them a royalty for each cubic yard of gravel taken away.
REASONING,"It was held that the royalties were not part of the profits of the business because, in granting the licences, the taxpayer was exploit ing his rights of ownership in the land and was not carrying on his business of a sand and gravel merchant."
REASONING,The income was held taxable as an income from an investment and did not fall under Schedule D which concerns profits earned from a trade.
REASONING,Mr. Chatterjee also laid emphasis on the observations of Lord (1) (2) [1947] 1 A.E.R. 798.
PRECEDENT,"8 Greene M.R. in Croft vs Sywell Aerodrome Ltd. (1), wherein the learned Master of the Rolls observed as fol lows: ""I cannot myself see that a person who leases the land to others, or grants licences to others to come upon it, is doing anything more than exploiting his own rights of property, even if the tenant or licensee is, by the terms of the lease or licence, entitled himself to carry on a trade on the land."
REASONING,""" It was urged that what the assessee was doing in this case was exploiting his rights of property by letting the dyeing plant to other persons precisely in the same manner as the owner of land in the case cited above was exploiting his own rights to property by granting a licence to another to come on his land."
REASONING,"The argument, in our opinion, though attractive, is fallacious."
REASONING,The analogy between the case of land and of a dyeing plant for the purpose of taxing stat utes is inappropriate.
PRECEDENT,"The distinction becomes apparent from the following passage which occurs in Atkinson J. 's judgment in I les 's case(2) : ""Then it was suggested by counsel for the Crown that the case was like the Desoutter case(3), where it was held that, if you make use of a patent in your business and also receive royalties from the use of the patent by others licensed to use it, those royalties cannot be regarded as receipts from an investment."
PRECEDENT,"In other words, the door has to be either open or shut."
PRECEDENT,A patent is either an investment or it is not.
REASONING,"The suggestion was that freehold land is in the same position, and if you carry on business on part of it, whatever you do with the rest by way of licensing or letting cannot be regarded as producing income from investment."
PRECEDENT,"That, however, is dead in the teeth of the judgment in the Broadway Car Co. case(4)."
PRECEDENT,"The same argument was tried there, but Tucker L.J. said he thought the Desoutter case(3) had very little to do with it, as there was a great difference between land (1) (3) (2) (4) 9 and a patent, and he did not think the Desoutter case(1) threw any light on the matter ."
REASONING,"A patent is quite different from freehold land."" These observations appositely apply to the case of a company incorporated for the purpose of doing business and earning profit by the process of manufacture."
REASONING,Letting out a part of its machinery in a certain situation in order to make the business advantageous as a whole does not alter the nature of the income.
REASONING,"The case of an owner of land letting out his land and carrying on exploitation of part of that land by selling gravel out of it, as at present advised, in our opinion, would fall under section 9 of the Indian In come tax Act, as income earned, no matter by whatever meth od, from land, and specifically dealt with by that section."
PRECEDENT,The observations therefore made in I les 's case(2) can have no apposite application to the case of a manufacturing concern letting out a part of its machinery temporarily which it cannot advantageously use itself.
PRECEDENT,Mr. Chatterjee also laid stress on the decision of the Court of Appeal in Inland Revenue Commissioners vs Broadway Car Co. Ltd.(3).
REASONING,In this case the company carried on the business of motor car agents and repairers on land held on lease from 1935 to 1956 at an annual rent of pound 750.
REASONING,By 1940 the company 's business had dwindled under war condi tions to such an extent that no more than one third of the land was required.
REASONING,"In those circumstances the remainder was sublet for fourteen years at an annual rent of pound 1,150."
REASONING,"The general commissioners of income tax decided that the difference of pound 400 between the outgoing of pound 750 for the land retained and the incoming of pound 1,150 for the land disposed of was ""income received from an invest ment,"" and, the business not being one within the special categories mentioned in the Finance Act, 1939, that pound 400 was not taxable."
REASONING,"It was held that the word ""investment"" must be construed in the ordinary, popular sense of the word as used by businessmen and not as a (1) [1946] 1 A.E.R.58."
REASONING,(2) 2 10 term of art having a defined or technical meaning and that it was impossible to say that the commissioners had erred in law in coming to the conclusion that the transaction result ed in an investment.
REASONING,"Scott L.J. in delivering his judgment laid emphasis on the point that after the business of the company had dwindled, it partitioned part of the land from the rest and sublet it by installing a heating apparatus for the sub lessee."
REASONING,It was found that war conditions had reduced the company 's business to very small proportions and they cut their loss by going out of business in respect of the major part of their land and put it out of their power for 14 years to resume business there.
REASONING,In this situation it was observed that in that case they were dealing with part of the property of the company which had come redundant and was sublet purely to produce income a transaction.
REASONING,quite apart from the ordinary business activities of the company.
REASONING,"It was pointed out that the question whether a particular source of income was income or not must be decided, as it could be, according to ordinary commonsense principles."
REASONING,"The short question to decide in this case is whether on the facts found, it could be said reasonably that the dyeing plant had become redundant for its business as a silk manu facturing concern, simply by the circumstance that for the time being it could not be used by it personally for the purpose of dyeing silk yarn owing to the non availability of yarn."
REASONING,It is difficult to conceive that the company would not have immediately started dyeing yarn as soon as it became available.
REASONING,"Instead of dyeing yarn, another person was allowed to dye jute (we are told), the assessee company making income out of its use as a commercial asset."
REASONING,In this situation it is not possible to hold that the income thus earned was not a part of the income of the business and was not earned for the business by its commercial asset or that this commercial asset had become redundant to the company 's business of manufacture of silk.
REASONING,"The analogy of Broadway Car Co. Ltd. (1) therefore does not hold good for the decision of the present matter, (1) 11 We are therefore of the opinion that it was a part of the normal activities of the assessee 's business to earn money by making use of its machinery by either employing it in its own manufacturing concern or temporarily letting it to others for making profit for that business when for the time being it could not itself run it."
REASONING,"The High Court therefore was in error in holding that the dyeing plant had ceased to be a commercial asset of the assessee and the income earned by it and received from the lessee, Messrs Parakh & Co., was not chargeable to excess profits tax."
REASONING,The result therefore is that we hold that the answer returned by the High Court to the question referred to it by the Tribu nal was wrong and that the correct answer to the question would be in the affirmative and not in the negative.
REASONING,"The appeal is allowed, but in the circumstances of the case we make no order as to costs."
REASONING,We have not thought it necessary to refer to all the cases cited at the Bar as none of them really is in point on the short question that we were called upon to decide and analogies drawn from them would not be helpful in arriving at our decision.
RPC,Appeal allowed.
RPC,Agent for the appellant.
NAME,"Harla vs The State Of Rajasthan on 24 September, 1951"
CITATION,"Equivalent citations: 1951 AIR 467, 1952 SCR 110"
COUNSEL,H. J. Umrigar for the appellant.
COUNSEL,G. C. Mathur for the respondent.
JUDGE,The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Bose J.
FACTS,The appellant was convicted under section 7 of the Jaipur Opium Act and fined Rs. 50.
RLC,The case as such is trivial but the High Court of Rajasthan in Jaipur granted special leave to appeal as an important point touching the vires of the Act arises.
FACTS,We will state the facts chronolog ically.
FACTS,It is conceded that the Rulers of Jaipur had full powers of government including those of legislation.
FACTS,"On the 7th of September, 1922, the late Maharaja died and at the time of his death his successor, the present Maharaja, was a minor."
FACTS,"Accordingly, the Crown Representative appointed a Council of Ministers to look after the government and administration of the State during the Maharaja 's minority On the 11th of December, 1923, this Council passed a Resolution which purported to enact the Jaipur Opium Act, and the only question is whether the mere passing of the Resolution without promulgation or publication in the Ga zette, or other means to make the Act known to the public, was sufficient to make it law."
REASONING,We are of opinion that it was not.
FACTS,"But before giving our reasons for so holding, we will refer to some further facts."
FACTS,"About the same time (that is to say, in the year 1923 we have not been given the exact date) the same Council enacted the Jaipur Laws Act, 1923."
STATUTE,"Section 3(b) of this Act provided as follows : ""3."
STATUTE,"Subject to the prerogative of the Ruler the law to be administered by the Court of Jaipur State shall be as follows: (b) All the regulations now in force within the said territories, and the enactments and regulations that may hereafter be passed from time to time by the State and published in the Official Gazette."
FACTS,""" This law came into force on the 1st of November, 1924."
FACTS,"It is admitted that the Jaipur Opium Act was never published in the Gazette either before or after the 1st of November, 1924."
FACTS,"But it is contended that was 112 not necessary because it was a ""regulation"" already in force on that date."
FACTS,"The only other fact of consequence is that on the 19th of May, 1938, section 1 of the Jaipur Opium Act was amended by the addition of sub section (c) which ran as follows: ""(c) It shall come into force from the 1st of September, 1924."
FACTS,""" The offence for which the appellant was convicted took place on the 8th of October, 1948."
FACTS,"Dealing first with the last of these Acts, namely the one of the 19th of May, 1938, we can put that on one side at once because, unless the Opium Act was valid when made, the mere addition of a clause fourteen years later stating that it shall come into force at a date fourteen years earlier would be useless."
FACTS,"In the year 1938 there was a law which required all enactments after the 1st of November, 1924, to be published in the Gazette."
FACTS,"Therefore, if the Opium Act was not a valid Act at that date, it could not be validated by the publication of only one section of it in the Gazette fourteen years later."
FACTS,The Jaipur Laws Act of 1923 required the whole of the enactment to be published; therefore publi cation of only one section would not validate it if it was not already valid.
REASONING,"We need not consider whether a law could be made retroactive so as to take effect from 1924 by publi cation in 1938, though that point was argued."
REASONING,That throws us back to the position in 1923 and raises the question whether a law could be brought into operation by a mere resolution of the Jaipur Council.
REASONING,We do not know what laws were operative in Jaipur re garding the coming into force of an enactment in that State.
REASONING,"We were not shown any, nor was our attention drawn to any custom which could be said to govern the matter."
REASONING,"In the absence of any special law or custom, we are of opinion that it would be against the principles of natural justice to permit the subjects of a State to be punished or penalised by laws of which they had no knowledge and of which they could not even with the exercise of reasonable diligence have acquired any knowledge."
REASONING,Natural justice requires that 113 before a law can become operative it must be promulgated or published.
REASONING,"It must be broadcast in some recognisable way so that all men may know what it is; or, at the very least, there must be some special rule or regulation or customary channel by or through which such knowledge can be acquired with the exercise of due and reasonable diligence."
REASONING,"The thought that a decision reached in the secret recesses of a chamber to which the public have no access and to which even their accredited representatives have no access and of which they can normally know nothing, can nevertheless affect their lives, liberty and property by the mere passing of a Resolution without anything more is abhorrent to civilised man."
REASONING,It shocks his conscience.
REASONING,"In the absence therefore of any law, rule, regulation or custom, we hold that a law cannot come into being in this way."
REASONING,Promulgation or publica tion of some reasonable sort is essential.
REASONING,"In England the rule is that Acts of Parliament become law from the first moment of the day on which they receive the Royal assent, but Royal Proclamations only when actually published in the official Gazette."
REASONING,See footnote (a) to paragraph 776.
REASONING,"page 601, of Halsbury 's Laws of England (Hailsham edition), Volume VI and 32 Halsbury 's Laws of England (Hailsham edition), page 150 note (r)."
REASONING,"But even there it was necessary to enact a special Act of Parliament to enable such proclamations to become law by publication in the Gazette though a Royal Proclamation is the highest kind of law, other than an Act of Parliament, known to the Brit ish Constitution; and even the publication in the London Gazette will not make the proclamation valid in Scotland nor will publication in the Edinburgh Gazette make it valid for England."
REASONING,It is clear therefore that the mere enacting or signing of a Royal Proclamation is not enough.
REASONING,"There must be publication before it can become law, and in England the nature of the publication has to be prescribed by an Act of Parliament."
REASONING,The Act of Parliament regulating this matter is the Crown Office Act of 1877 ' (40 and 41 Victoria Ch. 41).
REASONING,"That Act, in addition to making provision for publication in certain official Gazettes, also provides for the 114 making of rules by Order in Council for the best means of making Proclamations known to the public."
REASONING,"The British Par liament has therefore insisted in the Crown Office Act that not only must there be publication in the Gazette but in addition there must be other modes of publication,if an Order in Council so directs, so that the people at large may know what these special laws are."
REASONING,The Crown Office Act directs His Majesty in Council carefully to consider the best mode of making these laws known to the public and empowers that body to draw up rules for the same and embody them in an Order in Council.
REASONING,"We take it that if these Proc lamations are not published strictly in accordance with the rules so drawn up, they will not be valid law."
REASONING,The principle underlying this question has been judi cially considered in England.
PRECEDENT,"For example, on a somewhat lower plane, it was held in Johnson vs Sargant (1) that an Order of the Food Controller under the Beans, Peas and Pulse (Requisition) Order, 1917 does not become operative until it is made known to the public, and the difference between an Order of that kind and an Act of the British Parliament is Stressed."
REASONING,The difference is obvious.
REASONING,Acts of the British Parliament are publicly enacted.
REASONING,The debates are open to the public and the Acts are passed by the accredited representa tives of the people who in theory can be trusted to see that their constituents know what has been done.
REASONING,"They also re ceive wide publicity in papers and, now, over the wireless."
REASONING,Not so Royal Proclamations and Orders of a Food Controller and so forth.
REASONING,There must therefore be promulgation and publication in their cases.
REASONING,The mode of publication can vary; what is a good method in one country may not neces sarily be the best in another.
REASONING,But reasonable publication of some sort there must be.
REASONING,Nor is the principle peculiar to England.
REASONING,"It was ap plied to France by the Code Napoleon, the first Article of which states that the laws are executory ""by virtue of the promulgation thereof"" and that they shall come into effect ""from the moment at which their (1) ; 115 promulgation can have been known."" So also it has been applied in India in, for instance, matters arising under Rule 119 of the Defence of India Rules."
PRECEDENT,"See, for example, Crown vs Manghumal Tekuml(1), Shakoor vs King Emperor (2) and Babulal vs King Emperor (3)."
REASONING,It is true none of these cases is analogous to the one before us but they are only particular applications of a deeper rule which is rounded on natural justice.
REASONING,The Council of Ministers which passed the Jaipur Opium Act was not a sovereign body nor did it function of its own right.
REASONING,"It was brought into being by the Crown Representa tive, and the Jaipur Gazette Notification dated the 11th August, 1923, defined and limited its powers."
REASONING,"We are enti tled therefore to import into this matter consideration of the principles and notions of natural justice which underlie the British Constitution, for it is inconceivable that a representative of His Britannic Majesty could have contem plated the creation of a body which could wield powers so abhorrent to the fundamental principles of natural justice which all freedom loving peoples share."
REASONING,"We hold that, in the absence of some specific law or custom to the contrary, a mere resolution of a Council of Ministers in the Jaipur State without further publication or promulgation would not be sufficient to make a law operative."
REASONING,It is necessary to consider another point.
STATUTE,It was urged that section 3(b) of the Jaipur Laws Act of 1923 saved all regulations then in force from the necessity of publication in the Gazette.
REASONING,"That may be so, but the Act only saved laws which were valid at the time and not resolutions which had never acquired the force of law."
RPC,The appeal succeeds.
RPC,The conviction and sentence are set aside.
RPC,"The fine, if paid, will be refunded."
RPC,Appeal allowed.

JUDGE,The Judgment of the Court was delivered by KANIA C.J.
FACTS,These are five companion appeals from the judgments of the High Court of East Punjab and the principal point argued before us is as to the legality of the deten tion of the appellants under the Preventive Detention Act on the ground that they are engaged in black marketing in cotton piecegoods.
FACTS,The Jullundur Wholesale Cloth Syndicate was formed to work out the distribution of cloth under the Government of Punjab Control (Cloth) Order passed under the Essential Supplies Act.
FACTS,Certain persons who held licences as whole sale dealers in cloth formed themselves into a corporation and all cloth controlled by the Government was distributed in the district to the retail quota holders through them.
FACTS,The Government allotted quotas to the retailers and orders were issued by the Government for giving each retailer certain bales under the distribution control.
FACTS,"If some of the retail licence holders did not take delivery of the quotas allotted to them under the Notification of the 4th of October, 1950, issued by the Government of India, Department of Industries and Supplies, it was, inter alia, provided that the wholesale syndicate may give the bales not so lifted to another retail dealer."
FACTS,It may be noted that all along the price for the cloth to be sold wholesale and retail had been fixed under Government orders.
FACTS,The Syndi cate was suspected to be dealing in black market and had been warned against its activities by the District Magis trate of Jullundur several times.
FACTS,"On the 7th of June, 1951, 21 an order was issued by the District Organiser, Civil Sup plies and Rationing, Jullundur, to the managing agents of the wholesale cloth corporation, Jullundur City, intimating that they were strictly forbidden to dispose of any uplifted stock against unexpired terms without his prior permission in writing."
FACTS,"They were further directed that thenceforth no such stock would be allowed to be sold to an individual retailer, but permission would be granted to sell the same to associations of retailers only."
FACTS,"It was stated that this letter was not in accordance with clause 5 of the Notifica tion of the Government of India dated the 4th October, 1950, which authorized the wholesale syndicate to be at liberty to sell uplifted cloth to any other retailer or an association of retail dealers of the same district."
FACTS,It may be further noted that the Cotton Cloth Control Order was in operation even prior to 1950.
FACTS,For some time control on the distribu tion of cloth was lifted but the price remained under the control of the Government.
FACTS,During that time it has been alleged that the appellants and several others sold cloth at rates higher than those fixed by the Government.
FACTS,"Even when the distribution and price were both controlled, the manu facturing mills were allowed to sell at prices fixed by the Government a certain percentage of cloth which was not taken by the Government under its control."
FACTS,This was described as free sale cloth and it was alleged that the appellants and several others were doing black marketing in this free sale cloth.
RLC,"By an order passed by the District Magistrate on 19th June, 1951, he directed that the appellants be detained under section 3 (2) of the Preventive Detention Act to prevent them from acting in a manner prejudicial to the maintenance of supplies of cloth, essential to the communi ty."
RLC,"On the 2nd July, 1951, the District Magistrate, Jullun dur, directed that the appellants be committed to District Jail, Jullundur, from the 2nd July until the 1st October, 1951."
RLC,The appellants were detained accordingly.
FACTS,The grounds for their detention were given to them on the morn ing of the 6th July.
FACTS,The grounds set out the activities of 22 the appellants as managing agents or partners in different firms or employees of the said firms or corporations.
FACTS,"It was stated ,that they had been disposing of most of the stocks of cloth received for the Jullundur District in the black market at exhorbitant rates from June, 1949, to Octo ber, 1950, during the period when control on distribution was removed and that even after the reimposition of that control in October, 1950, they disposed of cloth which has been frozen under the directions of Director of Civil Sup plies in the short interval between the passing of the order and its service on them."
FACTS,"The second ground was in respect of their individual activities as members of the firm in which they were partners in disposing of stocks of cloth in black market at rates higher than the controlled ones, to various dealers, through agents."
FACTS,The particulars were speci fied in Appendix 'A '.
FACTS,They refer to the free sale cloth.
FACTS,In the third ground it was alleged that ' by illegal means they deprived the rightful claimants of the various stocks of cloth with a view to pass the same into black market at exorbitant rates.
REASONING,We do not think it necessary to go into greater details of these grounds or refer to the other grounds.
FACTS,"On the 9th of July, 1951, petitions under article 226 of the Constitution of India were filed in the East Punjab High Court asking for writs of habeas corpus against the State on the ground that the detention of the appellants under the Preventive Detention Act was illegal."
FACTS,The District Magis trate filed his affidavit in reply challenging the allega tion of mala fides and setting out in some detail instances of the activities of the appellants and contended that on the reports received by him he was satisfied that the deten tion of the appellants was necessary.
FACTS,"Early in August, 1951, the executive authorities cancelled the licence of the appellants as cloth dealers."
RLC,The High Court dismissed the petitions and the petitioners have come on appeal to us.
STATUTE,"Section 3 of the , pro vides that the Central Government or the State Government may, if satisfied with respect to any person that 23 with a view to preventing him from acting in any manner prejudicial to the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the community it is necessary so to do, make an order directing that such person be detained."
STATUTE,The power to act in accordance with the terms of this provision was given by section 3 (2) to a District Magistrate.
FACTS,"Such Magistrate however was required to make a report to the State Govern ment to which he was subordinate about the order and also to send the grounds on which the order had been made and such other particulars as, in his opinion, had a bearing on the necessity of the order."
FACTS,It is not disputed that an order under section 3 (2) of the to prevent black marketing can be passed by the District Magistrate.
ARG,"On behalf of the appellants it is contended that in the grounds for their detention reference is made to their activities prior to June, 1951, only."
REASONING,This cannot be considered objectionable because having regard to those activities it is alleged that the satisfaction required under the section had arisen.
ARG,"It was next argued that such loophole as existed in the total control of distribution and ' sale and price of piecegoods in the district was sealed by the order of the District Orga niser dated the 7th June, 1951."
REASONING,"By virtue of that order the syndicate or corporation could not sell any cloth without an express order in writing from the District Organiser, and therefore there could be no black marketing after that date by any of the appellants and the order was therefore unjus tified."
REASONING,It was next contended that in any event now as their licences are cancelled they cannot deal in cloth and the order of detention now maintained against them is more in the nature of punishment than prevention.
REASONING,"It was argued that orders under the were for the purpose of preventing a person from acting in future in the objectionable way contemplated by the Act and it was beyond the scope of the Act to pass orders in respect of their alleged activities anterior to June, 1951."
REASONING,In our opinion the High Court approached the matter quite correctly.
REASONING,Instances of past activities are relevant 24 to be considered in giving rise to the subjective mental conviction of the District Magistrate that the appellants were likely to indulge in objectionable activities.
REASONING,The grounds which were given for the detention are relevant and the question whether they are sufficient or not is not for the decision of the Court.
REASONING,The Legislature has made only the subjective satisfaction of the authority making the order essential for passing the order.
REASONING,"The contention that because in the Amending Act of 1951 an Advisory Board is constitut ed, which can supervise and override the decision taken by the executive authority, and therefore the question whether the grounds are sufficient to give rise to the satisfaction has become a justifiable issue in Court, is clearly unsound."
REASONING,"The satisfaction for making the initial order is and has always been under the , that of the authority making the order."
REASONING,"Because the Amending Act of 1951 establishes a supervisory authority, that discretion and subjective test is not taken away and by the establish ment of the Advisory Board, in our opinion, the Court is not given the jurisdiction to decide whether the subjective decision of the authority making the order was right or not."
REASONING,"Proceeding on the footing, therefore, that the jurisdiction to decide whether the appellants should be detained under the on the grounds conveyed to the appellants is of the District Magistrate."
REASONING,"In the present cases, two arguments were advanced on behalf of the appel lants."
REASONING,"It was strenuously urged that by reason of the order of the District Organiser of the 7th June, 1951, the only loophole which remained in the scheme of distribution and sale of cloth under control of the Government was sealed and it was impossible after that order to do any blackmarketing by any of the appellants."
REASONING,We are unable to accept this contention.
REASONING,"In the first place, this order appears to be an administrative order and is in the nature of a warning."
REASONING,"It is at variance with the provisions of clause 5 of the Order of the Central Government of the 4th October, 1950."
REASONING,Moreover this order does not bring about the result claimed for it.
REASONING,"A lot 25 of cloth which the manufacturers are permitted to distribute through persons outside the Government agencies can still be secured and sold at exhorbitant rates, i.e., at rates higher than those fixed by the Government."
REASONING,The second argument was that as the licences of the appellants are now cancelled they cannot deal in textile cloth at all and therefore there can be no apprehension of their indulging in black market activities.
REASONING,We are unable to accept this argument also because it is common knowledge that licences can be obtained in the name of nominees.
REASONING,Again while these people may not have their licences in Jullundur District they may have or may obtain licences in other districts.
REASONING,From the fact that their licences have been cancelled a month after the order of detention was passed we are unable to hold that it is impossible on that ground for the appellants to indulge in black market activities.
REASONING,"In this connection an extract from the further affidavit of the District Magistrate of Jullun dur dated 1st August, 1951, may be usefully noticed."
REASONING,"He stated: ""There have been orders for the release of certain stocks of cloth in respect of other mills, as free sale cloth after the 9th June, 1951."
REASONING,"Any quantity of cloth not paid for and lifted by the owners ' nominees will revert to the Mills for free sale: vide letter No. CYC 2/ SLM, dated the 31st May, 1951, from the Textile Commissioner, Bombay, to all selected Mills in Bombay and Ahmedabad."
REASONING,"This cloth can be purchased by any wholesale dealer of cloth of India, without any restriction."
REASONING,"Not only this, free sale cloth can be transported from one district to another without a per mit: vide Memo No. 28894 CS (C) 50/48791, dated 2nd January, 1951, from the Joint Director, Civil Supplies, and Under Secretary to Government Punjab to the District Organiser, Civil Supplies and Rationing, Ludhiana."
REASONING,Again free sale cloth is also procurable from individual firms who conspired to make profit by black marketing.
REASONING,The only information which is supplied by a purchaser of wholesale cloth to the District Magistrate is as to what quantity of such cloth has been imported 4 26 into the district.
REASONING,According to the report of the District Organiser no such cloth was imported into Jullundur by the corporation but there are reasons to believe that the Corpo ration had been making their purchases in free sale cloth from the Mills and using those bales to make up the defi ciency in the bales of quota cloth of superior quality which they used to dispose of in the black market in collusion with the Mills.
REASONING,"Besides, the firm Rattan Chand Mathra Dass, as would be evident from the attached lists signed by the District Organiser, had been dealing in free sale cloth and had also been importing cloth as Reserve of Kangra and also Provincial Reserve."
REASONING,Most of this quota also found its way into the black market.
REASONING,Similarly the firm Madan Gopal Nand Lall and Company had been dealing in free sale cloth on a large scale.
REASONING,It would be evident from the attached list.
REASONING,"Santi Sarup, the Secretary of the Corporation, is believed to be a partner in the firm Hari Chand Bindra Ban and this firm also had been dealing in free sale cloth."
REASONING,The free sale cloth acquired by them used to be invariably sold in the black market as reported by the District Organiser in his Memo No. 6306/6734 M/CT/Do.
REASONING,"7 dated 1st August, 1950, in reply to my Memo."
REASONING,"No. nil dated 30th July, 1951."
REASONING,"There is absolutely no bar for the wholesale cloth corporation, Jullundur, to its getting free sale cloth from the Mills or other wholesale dealers nor is there any bar for the firms Rattan Chand Mathra Dass and Madan Gopal Nand Lal and Co. to the acquiring of free sale cloth."
REASONING,""" It was next argued on behalf of the appellants that the only order of detention made against them was the order of the 2nd July and that did not refer to any section of the and did not suggest that there was any satisfaction of the detaining authority."
REASONING,It was argued that no order of the 19th of June was ever shown to any of the appellants or served on them and therefore their deten tion was illegal.
REASONING,"It should be pointed out that these con tentionsare raised in the affidavits not of the detained persons, but of their relations."
REASONING,Their affidavits do not show that they have any personal knowledge.
REASONING,The affidavits 27 on this point are based only on their belief and information and the source of the information is not even disclosed.
REASONING,"As against this, there is the affidavit of the District Magis trate which expressly states that the terms of the Order of the 19th of June were fully explained to each of the dete nus."
REASONING,The petitions for the writs of habeas corpus were filed within a week after the service of the detention order and we do not think there is any reason to doubt the cor rectness of the statements of the District Magistrate.
REASONING,In our opinion this ground of attack on the order of detention has no substance and the detention cannot be held illegal on that ground.
REASONING,The judgment of the High Court was attacked on these grounds and as we are unable to accept any of these contentions the appeals must fail.

NAME,"Romesh Thappar vs The State Of Madras on 26 May, 1950 "
CITATION,"Equivalent citations: 1950 AIR 124, 1950 SCR 594 "
COUNSEL,"C.R.Pattabhi Raman, for the petitioner."
COUNSEL,"K. Rajah Ayyar, Advocate General of MadraS, (Ganapathi Ayyar, with him) for the opposite party."
JUDGE,"The Judgment of Kania C.J., Mehr Chand Mahajan, Mukherjea and Das JJ."
JUDGE,was delivered by Patanjali Sastri J. Fazl Ali J. delivered a separate judgment.
FACTS,"The petitioner is the printer, publisher and editor of a recently started weekly journal in English called Cross Roads printed and published in Bombay."
FACTS,"The Government of Madras, the respondents herein, in exer cise of their powers under section 9 (1 A) of the Madras Maintenance of Public Order Act, 1949 (hereinafter referred to as the impugned Act) purported to issue an order No. MS."
FACTS,"1333 dated 1st March, 1950, whereby they imposed a ban upon the entry and circulation of the journal in that State."
FACTS,"The order was published in the Fort St. George Gazette and the notification ran as follows : ""In exercise of the powers conferred by section 9 (I A) of the Madras Maintenance of Public Order, Act, 1949 (Madras Act XXIII of 1949) His Excellency the Governor of Madras, being satisfied that for the purpose of securing the public safety and the maintenance of public order, it is necessary so to do, hereby prohibits, with effect on and from the date of publication of this order in the Fort St. George Gazette the entry into or the circulation, sale or distribution in the State of Madras or any part thereof of the newspaper entitled Cross Roads an English weekly published at Bombay."
ARG,""" The petitioner claims that the said order contravenes the fundamental right of the petitioner to freedom of See the headnote to Brij Bhushan vs The State of Delhi, p. 605 infra."
ARG,596 speech and expression conferred on him by article 19 (1) (a) of the Constitution and he challenges the validity of section 9 (1 A) of the impugned Act as being void under article 13 (1) of the Constitution by reason of its being inconsistent with his fundamental right aforesaid.
ARG,"The Advocate General of Madras appearing on be half of the respondents raised a preliminary objection, not indeed to the jurisdiction of this Court to entertain the application under article 32, but to the petitioner resort ing to this Court directly for such relief in the first instance."
ARG,"He contended that, as a matter of orderly proce dure, the petitioner should first resort to the High Court at Madras which under article 226 of the Constitution has concurrent jurisdiction to deal with the matter."
ARG,"He cited criminal revision petitions under section 435 of the Crimi nal Procedure Code, applications for bail and applications for transfer under section 24 of the Civil Procedure Code as instances where, concurrent jurisdiction having been given in certain matters to the High Court and the Court of a lower grade, a rule of practice has been established that a party should proceed first to the latter Court for relief before resorting to the High Court."
PRECEDENT,"He referred to Emperor vs Bisheswar Prasad Sinha (1) where such a rule of practice was enforced in a criminal revision case, and called our attention also to certain American decisions Urquhart vs Brown (2) and Hooney vs Kolohan (3) as showing that the Supreme Court of the United States ordinarily required that whatever judicial remedies remained open to the appli cant in Federal and State Courts should be exhausted before the remedy in the Supreme Court be it habeas corpus or certiorari would be allowed."
REASONING,We are of opinion that neither the instances mentioned by the learned Advocate General nor the American decisions referred to by him are really analogous to the remedy afforded by article 32 of the Indian Constitution.
STATUTE,"That article does not merely confer power on this Court, as article 226 does on the (1) I.L.R. 56 All."
STATUTE,"(2) ; (3) ; 597 High Courts, to issue certain writs for the enforcement of the rights conferred by Part III or for any other purpose, as part of its general jurisdiction."
STATUTE,In that case it would have been more appropriately placed among articles 131 to 139 which define that jurisdiction.
STATUTE,"Article 32 provides a ""guaranteed"" remedy for the enforcement of those rights, and this remedial right is itself made a fundamental right by being included in Part 1II."
REASONING,No similar provision is to be found in the Constitution of the United States and we do not consider that the American decisions are in point.
REASONING,"Turning now to the merits, there can be no doubt that freedom of speech and expression includes freedom of propa gation of ideas, and that freedom is ensured by the freedom of circulation."
PRECEDENT,See also LoveIl vs City of Griffin(s).
REASONING,"It is therefore perfectly clear that the order of the Gov ernment of Madras would be a violation of the petitioner 's fundamental right under article 19 (1) (a), unless section 9 (1 A) of the impugned Act under which it was made is saved by the reservations mentioned in clause (2) of article 19 which (omitting immaterial words regarding laws relating to libel, slander, etc., with which we are not concerned in this case) saves the operation of any ""existinglaw in so far as it relates to any matter which undermines the security of, or tends to overthrow, the State."
REASONING,""" The question accord ingly arises whether, the impugned Act, in so far as it purports by section 9 (1 A) to authorise the Provincial Government ""for the purpose of securing the public safety or the maintenance of public order, to prohibit or regulate the entry into (1) ; (2) ; 598 or the circulation, sale or distribution in the Province of Madras or any part thereof of any document or class of documents"" is a ""law relating to any matter which undermines the security of or tends to overthrow the State."" The impugned Act was passed by the Provincial Legisla ture in exercise of the power conferred upon it by section 100 of the Government of India Act 1935, read with Entry 1 of List II of the Seventh Schedule to that Act, which com prises among other matters, ""public order."
REASONING,""" Now ""public order"" is an expression of wide connotation and signifies that state of tranquillity which prevails among the members of a political society as a result of the internal regula tions enforced by the government which they have estab lished."
REASONING,"Although section 9 (I A) refers to ""securing the public safety"" and ""the maintenance of public order"" as distinct purposes, it must be taken that ""public safety"" is used as a part of the wider concept of public order, for, if public safety were intended to signify any 'matter distinct from and outside the content of the expression ""public order,"" it would not have been competent for the Madras Legislature to enact the provision so far as it relates to public safety."
REASONING,This indeed was not disputed on behalf of the respondents.
REASONING,"But it was urged that the expression ""public safety"" in the impugned Act, which is a statute relating to law and order, means the security of the Province, and, therefore, ' 'the security of the State"" with the meaning of article 19 (2)as ""the State"" has been defined in article 12 as including, among other things, the Government and the Legislature of each of the erstwhile Provinces."
PRECEDENT,"Much reli ance was placed in support of this view on Rex vs Wormwood Scrubbs Prison(1) where it was held that the phrase ""for securing the public safety and the ' defence of."
STATUTE,"the realm"" in section 1 of the Defence of the Realm (Consolidation) Act, 1914, was not limited to securing the country against a foreign foe but included also protection against internal disorder such as a rebellion."
REASONING,"In that sense, anything which tends to prevent dangers to public health may also be regarded as securing public safety."
REASONING,"The meaning of the expression must, however, vary according to the context."
STATUTE,"In the classification of offenCes in the Indian Penal Code, for instance, Chapter XIV enumerates the ""offences affecting the public health, safety, convenience, decency, and morals"" and it includes rash driving or riding on a public way (section 279) and rash navigation of a vessel (section 280), among others, as offences against public safety, while Chapter VI lists waging war against the Queen (section 121), sedition (section 124 A) etc."
STATUTE,"as ""offences against the State"", because they are calculated to undermine or affect the security of the State, and Chapter VIII defines ""of fences against the public tranquillity"" which include unlaw ful assembly (section 141) rioting (section 146), promot ing enmity between classes (section 153 A), affray (sec tion 159) etc."
REASONING,"Although in the context of a statute relat ing to law and order ""securing public safety"" may not in clude the securing of public health, it may well mean secur ing the public against rash driving on a public way and the like, and not necessarily the security of the State."
REASONING,"It was said that an enactment which provided for drastic remedies like preventive detention and ban on newspapers must be taken to relate to matters affecting the security of the State rather than trivial offences like rash driving, or an affray."
REASONING,"But whatever ends the impugned Act may have been intended to subserve, and whatever aims its framers may have had in view, its application and scope cannot, in the ab sence of limiting words in the statute itself, be restricted to those aggravated forms of prejudicial activity which are calculated to 600 endanger the security of the State."
REASONING,Nor is there any guar antee that those authorised to exercise the powers under the Act will in using them discriminate between those who act prejudicially to the security of the State and those who do not.
REASONING,"The Government of India Act, 1935, nowhere used the expression"" security of the State"" though it made provision under section 57 for dealing with crimes of violence intend ed to overthrow the Government."
REASONING,"While the administration of law and order including the maintenance of public order was placed in charge of a Minister elected by the people, the Governor was entrusted with the responsibility of combating the operations of persons who ""endangered the peace or tranquillity of the Province"" by committing or attempting to commit ""crimes of violence intended to overthrow the Govern ment."
REASONING,""" Similarly, article 352 of the Constitution empowers the President to make a Proclamation of Emergency when he is satisfied that the ""security of India or any part of the territory thereof is threatened by war or by external ag gression or by internal disturbance."
REASONING,""" These provisions recognise that disturbance of public peace or tranquillity may assume such grave proportions as to threaten the securi ty of the State."
REASONING,"As Stephen in his 'Criminal Law of England(1) observes: ' ' Unlawful assemblies, riots, insurrections, rebellions, levying of war, are offences which run into each other and are not capable of being marked off by perfectly defined boundaries."
REASONING,"All of them have in common one feature, namely, that the normal tranquillity of a civilised society is in each of the cases mentioned disturbed either by actual force or at least by the show and threat of it."
REASONING,""" Though all these offences thus involve disturbances of public tranquil lity and are in theory offences against public order, the difference between them being only a difference ' of degree, yet for the purpose of grading the punishment to be inflict ed in respect of them they may be classified into different minor categories as has been done by (1) Vol."
STATUTE,601 the Indian Penal Code.
REASONING,"Similarly, the Constitution, in formulating the varying criteria for permissible legislation imposing restrictions on the fundamental rights enumerated in article 19 (1), has placed in a distinct category those offences against public order which aim at undermining the security of the State or overthrowing it, and made their prevention the sole justification for legislative abridge ment of freedom of speech and expression, that is to say, nothing less than endangering the foundations of the State or threatening its overthrow could justify curtailment of the rights to freedom of speech and expression, while the right of peaceable assembly ""sub clause (b)"" and the right of association ""sub clause (c)"" may be restricted under clauses (3) and (4) of article 19 in the interests of"" public order,"" which in those clauses includes the security of the State."
REASONING,"The differentiation is also noticeable in Entry 3 of List III (Concurrent List) of the Seventh Sched ule, which refers to the ""security of a State"" and ""mainte nance of public order"" as distinct subjects of.legislation."
REASONING,"The Constitution thus requires a line to be drawn in the field of public order or tranquillity marking off, may be, roughly, the boundary between those serious and aggravated forms of public disorder which are calculated to endanger the security of the State and the relatively minor breaches of the peace of a purely local significance, treating for this purpose differences in degree as if they were differ ences in kind."
STATUTE,"It is also worthy of note that the word ""sedition"" which occurred in article 13 (2) of the Draft Constitution pre pared by the Drafting Committee was deleted before the article was finally."
PRECEDENT,"In this connection it may be recalled that the Federal Court had, in defining sedition in Niharendu Dutt Majumdar vs The King Emperor (1), held that ""the acts or words complained of must either incite to disorder or must be such as to satisfy reasonable men that that is their intention or tendency"", but the Privy Council overruled that 602 decision and emphatically reaffirmed the view expressed in Tilak 's case (1) to the effect that ""the offence ""consisted in exciting or attempting to excite in others certain bad feelings towards the Government and not in exciting or attempting to excite mutiny or rebellion, or any sort of actual disturbance, great or small "" King Emperor vs Sada shiv Narayan Bhalerao (2) Deletion of the word ""sedition"" from the draft article 13 (2), therefore, shows that criticism of Government exciting disaffection or bad feel ings towards it is not to be regarded as a justifying ground for restricting the freedom of expression and of the press, unless it is such as to undermine the security of or tend to overthrow the State."
REASONING,"It is also significant that the corre sponding Irish formula of ""undermining the public order or the authority of the State"" article 40 (6) (i) of the Constitution of Eire, [1937] did not apparently find favour with the framers of the Indian Constitution."
REASONING,"Thus, very narrow and stringent limits have been set to permissible legislative abridgement of the right of free speech and expression, and this was doubtless due to the realisation that freedom of speech and of the press lay at the founda tion of all democratic organisations, for without free political discussion no public education, so essential for the proper functioning of the processes of popular govern ment, is possible."
REASONING,A freedom of such amplitude might involve risks of abuse.
PRECEDENT,"But the framers of the Constitution may well have reflected, with Madison who was ""the leading spirit in the preparation of the First Amendment of the Federal Constitution,"" that ""it is better to leave a few of its noxious branches to their luxuriant growth, than, by pruning them away, to injure the vigour of those yielding the proper fruits."": [Quoted in Near vs Minnesotta (3)]."
REASONING,603 restrictions which it seeks to impose may have been con ceived generally in the interests of public order.
REASONING,"It follows that section 9 (1 A) which authorises imposition of restrictions for the wider purpose of securing public safety or the maintenance of public order falls outside the scope of authorised restrictions under clause (2), and is there fore void and unconstitutional."
REASONING,"It was, however, argued that section 9 (1 A) could not be considered wholly void, as, under article 13 (1), an existing law inconsistent with a fundamental right is void only to the extent of the inconsistency and no more."
REASONING,"In so far as the securing of the public safety or the maintenance of public order would include the ' security of the State, the impugned provision, as applied to the latter purpose, was covered by clause (2) of article 19 and must, it was said, be held to be valid."
REASONING,We are unable to accede to this contention.
RPC,"So long as the possibility of its being applied for purposes not sanctioned by the Consti tution cannot be ruled out, it must be held to be wholly unconstitutional and void."
REASONING,"In other words, clause (2) of article 19 having allowed the imposition of restrictions on the freedom of speech and expression only in cases where danger to the State is involved, an enactment, which is capable of being applied to cases where no such danger could arise, cannot be held to be constitutional and valid to any extent."
RPC,The application is therefore allowed and the order of the respondents prohibiting the entry and circulation of the petitioner 's journal in the State of Madras is hereby quashed.
RPC,"In this view, I would dismiss this petition, but I should like to add a few observations to supplement what I have said in the other case."
RPC,"I have bor rowed the words quoted within inverted commas from the preamble of the Act which shows its scope and necessity and the question raised before us attacking the, validity of the Act must be formulated in the manner I have suggested."
RPC,"If the answer to the question is in the affirmative, as I think it must be, then the impugned law which prohibits entry into the State of Madras of ""any document or class of documents"" for securing public safety and maintenance of public order should satisfy the requirements laid down in article 19 (2)of the Constitution."
RPC,"From the trend of the arguments addressed to us, it would appear that if a docu ment is seditious, its entry could be validly prohibited, because sedition is a matter which undermines the security of the State; but if, on the other hand, the document is calculated to disturb public tranquillity and affect public safety, its entry cannot be prohibited, because public disorder and disturbance of public tranquillity are not matters which undermine the security of the State."
PRECEDENT,"In Brij Bhushan and Another vs The State(1), I have quoted good authority to show that sedition owes its gravity to its tendency to create disorders and an authority on criminal law like Sir James Stephen has classed sedition as an of fence against public tranquillity."
RPC,"If so, how could sedi tion be a matter which would undermine the security of the State and public disorders and disturbance of public safety will not be such a matter? It was argued that a small riot or an affray will not (1) ; 605 undermine the security of the State, but to this line of argument there is a two fold answer : (1) The Act, as its preamble shows, is not intended for petty disorders but for disorders involving menace to the peace and tranquillity of the Province, (2) There are de grees of gravity in the offence of sedition also and an isolated piece of writing of mildly seditious character by one insignificant individual may not also, from the layman 's point of view, be a matter which undermines the security of the State, but that would not affect the law which aims at checking sedition."
RPC,"It was also said that the law as it stands may be misused by the State executive, but misuse of the law is one thing and its being unconstitutional is another."
RPC,We are here concerned with the latter aspect only.
RPC,Petition allowed.

CITATION,"Equivalent citations: 1952 AIR 145, 1952 SCR 478"
COUNSEL,"Bakshi Tek Chand (section K. Kapoor, with him) for the appel lant."
COUNSEL,"Achhru Ram (Jwala Prasad, with him) for the respondent."
JUDGE,The judgment of the Court was delivered by BoSE J.
FACTS,This is a litigation between two branches of a family whose common ancestor was one Megh Raj Singh The family tree is as follows: Megh Raj Singh Jawahar Singh Madan Singh Shankar Lal(d 1884) Brijlal (d. 1889 or (1890) Daughter: Met.
FACTS,"1 Deft. 2 Ghas Ram Onkar Prasad The dispute is about property which, according to the plaintiffs, formed part of Shanker Lal 's estate."
FACTS,The plain tiffs state that the two branches of the family were sepa rate at all material times; that on 480 Shanker Lal 's death in 1884 his daughter Mst.
FACTS,Mohan Dei (the defendants ' grandmother) succeeded to a limited estate.
FACTS,"The reversion opened out on her death in October 1929 and the plaintiffs are entitled as the next reversioners, for Mst."
FACTS,Mohan Dei 's son Shri Kishan Das predeceased her.
FACTS,The defendants admit that Shanker Lal was separate from the other branch of the family.
FACTS,They divide the property which their grandmother Mst.
FACTS,Mohan Dei possessed into two categories.
FACTS,"First, there was property which they say be longed to her."
FACTS,"These are properties which, according to them, she purchased or obtained under mortgages in her own right."
FACTS,"Next, there were properties which belonged exclu sively to her father and to which she succeeded as daughter."
FACTS,On Shanker Lal 's death disputes arose between Shanker Lal 's father 's brother 's son Brijlal (the plaintiffs ' grandfa ther) and the defendants ' grandmother Mst.
FACTS,"Brijlal claimed the entire estate by survivorship, his allegation being that Shanker Lal died in a state of joint ness with him and that all the properties were joint family properties."
RLC,This dispute was referred to arbitration and an award was delivered.
RLC,"Mohan Dei was given the suit properties as absolute owner and the rest of the estate then in dispute was given to Brijlal, A division was ef fected accordingly and ever since, that is to say, from 21 12 1884, the date of the award, down to 26 3 1941, the date of the suit, each branch has been in separate and uninter rupted possession of the properties respectively allotted to it and each has been dealing with them as absolute owner."
ARG,The defendants claim that the plaintiffs are bound by this award and are in any event estopped.
ARG,The defendants say that it gave Mst.
ARG,Mohan Dei an absolute estate.
ARG,The plaintiffs deny this and say she obtained only a limited estate.
RPC,"In our opinion, the defendants are right."
FACTS,"The operative portion runs thus: ""Having regard to the specifications give above, Brij Lal, first party, and Musammat Mohan Devi, the deceased 's female issue, second party, have been held entitled to shares, worth Rs. 28,500 and Rs. 42,482 10 0 respective ly in the said properties; and accordingly. two lots have been made and the first lot is allotted to the first party and the second lot to the second party; and henceforth the parties shall have no claim or liability against each other; and each party has become permanent owner (malikmustaqil) of his or her share; and each party should enter in proprietary possession and occupation of his or her respective share. "" The underlining is ours."
REASONING,"We do not think the words admit of any doubt, particu larly as the words ""malik mustaqil"" have been used: see Ram Gopal vs Nand Lal and Others (1) and Bishunath Prasad Singh vs Chandika Prasad Kumari (2)."
REASONING,But it was argued that the award must be viewed as a whole and that certain earlier passages show that this could not have been the intention. ]he passages relied on are these.
REASONING,"First, the finding that the properties claimed by Mst."
FACTS,Mohan Dei as her own really belonged to Shanker Lal.
FACTS,He had purchased some and acquired others through mortgages in her name but she was only a benamidar and had no title to them.
FACTS,"Second, that some of the properties in dispute were ancestral and the rest sell acquired, though whether with the help of ances tral funds or not the arbitrator was unable to determine."
FACTS,"Third, the arbitrator 's view of the Hindu law, namely that ""the brother should be the owner of the joint ancestral property and the daughter who has a male issue should be owner of the self acquired property."
FACTS,""" And lastly, this passage (1) ; at 773.(2)(1933) 60 I.A. 56 at 61 & 62. 482 ""Furthermore, when the 2nd party (Mohan Dei) has inher ited no property from her husband, she, in case of getting this share, will certainly settle down in Amroha and will make her father 's haveli as her abode and thus the haveli shall remain a bad as heretofore, and in this way the de ceased 's name will be perpetuated; and it is positive that, after the Musammat, this property shall devolve on her son, who will be the malik (owner) thereof, and later the de scendant of this son will become the owner thereof."
REASONING,""" We do not think these passages qualify the operative portion of the award and are unable to agree with the learned Judges of the High Court who hold they do."
REASONING,"In our opinion, the arbitrator was confused in his mind both as regards the facts as well as regards the law."
REASONING,"His view of the law may have been wrong but the words used are, in our opinion, clear and, in the absence of anything which would unambiguously qualify them, we must interpret them in their usual sense."
REASONING,"Some cases were cited in which the word ""malik"", and in one case the words ""malik mustaqil"" were held to import a limited estate because of qualifying circumstances."
REASONING,"We think it would be pointless to examine them because we are concerned here with the document before us and even if it be conceded that words which would ordinarily mean one thing can be qualified by other words and circumstances appearing in the same document, we are of opinion that the passages and circumstances relied on in this case do not qualify the strong, clear and unambiguous words used in this document."
REASONING,The learned counsel for the plaintiffs respondents had to search diligently for the meaning for which he contended in other passages and had to make several assumptions which do not appear on the face of the award as to what the arbitra tor must have thought and must have intended.
REASONING,We are not prepared to qualify clear and unambiguous language by phrases of dubious import which can be made to coincide with either view by calling in aid assumptions of fact about whose existence we can only guess 483 The award was attacked on other grounds also.
REASONING,"It was urged, among other things, that the arbitrator had travelled beyond the terms of his reference in awarding Mst."
FACTS,Mohan Dei an absolute interest.
FACTS,"It was also urged that even if Brij lal was bound his son Kishan Lal, who did not claim through him but who had an independent title as reversioner to Shanker Lal, would not be bound, and it was contended that if Kishan Lal was not bound the plaintiffs would not be either."
FACTS,But we need not examine these points because we do not need to proceed on the binding nature of the award.
FACTS,Even if the award be invalid we are of opinion that the plaintiffs ' claim is completely answered by the plea of estoppel.
FACTS,"Now it can be conceded that before an estoppel can arise, there must be, first, a representation of an existing fact as distinct from a mere promise de futuro made by one party to the other; second, that the other party, believing it, must have been induced to act on the faith of it; and third, that he must have so acted to his detriment."
FACTS,It will be necessary to deal with this in stages and first we will consider whether there was any estoppel against Brijlal.
FACTS,It is beyond dispute that he laid serious claim to the property in 1884.
FACTS,"He claimed that he was joint with Shanker Lal and so, on Shanker Lal 's death he became entitled to the whole of the estate and that Mst."
FACTS,Mohan Dei had only a right of maintenance.
FACTS,"Whether he would have had difficulty in establishing such a claim, or indeed whether it would have been impossible for him to do so, is wholly immaterial."
FACTS,"The fact remains that he pressed his claim and was serious about it, so much so that he was able to per suade the arbitrator that he had an immediate right to part of the estate."
FACTS,"Mohan Dei, on the other hand, resisted this claim and contended that she was entitled to separate and exclusive possession, and in any event, that she was entitled in absolute right to a part of the property."
FACTS,On the facts which now emerge it is evident that Brijlal had no right and that his hopes of one day succeeding as 484 reversioner were remote.
FACTS,"Mohan Dei had a son Shri Kishan Das who was the next presumptive reversioner and as the boy was a good deal younger than Brijlal, Brijlal 's chances were slim."
FACTS,"Actually, the boy survived Brijlal by nearly forty years."
FACTS,Brijlal died in 1889or 1890 and the boy did not die till March 1929.
FACTS,Had he lived another eight or nine months he would have succeeded and the plaintiffs would have been nowhere.
RLC,"It is neither here nor there whether the award was valid, whether the decision fell within the scope of the reference or whether it had any binding character in itself."
REASONING,"Even if it was wholly invalid, it was still open to the parties to say: Never mind whether the arbitrator was right or wrong, his decision is fair and sensible, so instead of wasting further time and money in useless litigation, we will accept it and divide the estate in accordance with his findings."
REASONING,"That would have been a perfectly right and proper settlement of the dispute, and whether it bound third parties or not it would certainly bind the immediate parties; and that in effect is what they did."
FACTS,"Mohan Dei to be lieve that this would be the case and on the faith of that representation, namely the acceptance of the award, he induced Mst."
FACTS,"Mohan Dei to act greatly to her detriment and to alter her position by accepting the award and parting with an appreciable portion of the estate, and he himself obtained a substantial advantage to which he would not otherwise have been entitled and enjoyed the benefit of it for the rest of his life; and to his credit be it said, he never attempted to go behind his decision."
FACTS,"In any event, we are clear that that created an estoppel as against Brijlal."
PRECEDENT,"In our opinion, the present case is very similar to the one which their Lordships of the Privy Council decided in Kanhai Lal vs Brij Lal (1)."
PRECEDENT,"There also there was a dispute between a limited owner and a person who, but for an un proved claim (adoption) which he (1) (1919) 45 I.A. 118."
PRECEDENT,"485 put forward, had no right to the estate."
PRECEDENT,The dispute was taken to the courts but was compromised and according to the agreement the property was divided between the two rival claimants and the agreement was given effect to and acted on for a period of twenty years.
PRECEDENT,"Later, the succession opened out and the other party to the compromise, who by then had stepped into the reversion, claimed the rest of the estate, which had been assigned to the limited owner, against her personal heirs."
PRECEDENT,"The Judicial Committee rejected the claim on the ground of estoppel and held that even though the plaintiff claimed in a different character in the suit, namely as reversioner, he having been a party to the compro mise and having acted on it and induced the other side to alter her position to her detriment, was estopped."
REASONING,We do not think the fact that there was a voluntary compromise whereas here there was the imposed decision of an arbitra tor.
REASONING,makes any difference because we are not proceeding on the footing of the award but on the actings of the parties in accepting it when they need not have done so if the present contentions are correct.
REASONING,It is true that in one sense a question of title is one of law and it is equally true that there can be no estoppel on a question of law.
REASONING,But every question of law must be grounded on facts and when Brijlal 's conduct is analysed it will be found to entail an assertion by him that he admitted and recognised facts which would in law give Mst.
FACTS,Mohan Dei an absolute interest in the lands awarded to her.
FACTS,"It was because of that assertion of fact, namely his recognition and admission of the existence of facts which would give Mst."
FACTS,"Mohan Dei an absolute interest, that she was induced to part with about one third of the property to which Brijlal, on a true estimate of the facts as now known, had no right."
FACTS,"There can be no doubt that she acted to her detriment and there can, we think, be equally no doubt that she was in duced to do so on the faith of Brijlal 's statements and conduct which induced her to believe that he accepted all the implications of the 63 486 award."
FACTS,"But in any event, we are clear that Brijlal would have been estopped."
FACTS,"The nature of the dispute and the de scription of it given in the award show that there was considerable doubt, and certainly much dispute, about the true state of affairs."
FACTS,"Even if the arbitrator was wholly wrong and even if he had no power to decide as he did, it was open to both sides to accept the decision and by their acceptance recognise the existence of facts which would in law give the other an absolute estate in the properties they agreed to divide among themselves and did divide."
FACTS,"That, in our opinion is a representation of an existing fact or set of facts."
FACTS,Each would consequently be estopped as against the other and Brijlal in particular would have been estopped from denying the existence of facts which would give Mst.
FACTS,Mohan Dei an absolute interest in the suit property.
FACTS,We turn next to his son Kishan Lal.
FACTS,Brijlal died in 1889 or 1890.
FACTS,At that date Mst.
FACTS,Mohan Dei 's son Shri Kishan Das was alive and was the next presumptive reversioner.
FACTS,Brijlal 's sons therefore had no more right to that portion of his estate which was assigned to Brijlal than Brijlal himself.
FACTS,"But they took possession and claimed through their father. ]hey did not claim an independent title in them selves, and, as we know, they had no other title at that date."
FACTS,"They were therefore in no better position than Brij lal and as Brijlal would have been estopped, the estoppel descended to them also because they stepped into his shoes."
FACTS,"This would be so even if Brijlal had claimed the property independently for himself, which he did not; but much more so as he claimed in joint family rights and evidently acted as karta or manager on behalf of his family."
FACTS,"But apart from this, there was also an independent estoppel in Kishan Lal."
FACTS,"We have said, he had no right to this part of the estate when his father died apart from the award."
FACTS,But nevertheless he took possession along with his brother and the two of them treated the property as their own and derived benefit 487 from it.
FACTS,They partitioned the estate between themselves and sold away parts of it to third parties.
FACTS,Kishan Lal knew of the award.
FACTS,He knew that mutation had been effected in accordance with it and possession taken by Brijlal under it and that the rest had been retained by Mst.
FACTS,Mohan Dei.
FACTS,"His retention of the property therefore and his continuing to deal with it on the basis of the award indicated his own acceptance of the award and, therefore, by his acts and conduct, he represented that he also, like his father, admitted the existence of facts which would in law give Mst."
FACTS,"Mohan Dei an absolute estate; and further, he allowed Mst."
FACTS,"Mohan Dei to deal with the estate as her own, for she, on her part."
FACTS,also acted on the award and claimed absolute rights in the property assigned to her.
FACTS,"She dealt with it on that footing and gifted it in that right to her grand sons, the contesting defendants, on 4th April, 1929."
FACTS,Muta tion was effected and Kishan Lal raised no objection.
FACTS,We see then that Brijlal retained possession of property to which he was not entitled for a period of five or six years from 1884 to 1889 or 1890 and induced Mst.
FACTS,"Mohan Dei to part with it by representing that he accepted the award and her abso lute title to the rest, and after him Kishan Lal and his brother between them enjoyed the benefit of it from 1889 or 1890 down to October 1929 when Mst."
FACTS,"Mohan Dei died, that is, for a further forty years, and led Mst."
FACTS,Mohan Dei to believe that they also acknowledged her title to an absolute estate.
FACTS,We have no doubt that down to that time Kishan Lal was also estopped for the reasons given above.
FACTS,Had he questioned the award and reopened the dispute Mst.
REASONING,Mohan Dei would at once have sued and would then for forty years have obtained the benefit of property from which she was excluded because of her acceptance of the award on the faith of Brijlal 's asser tion that he too accepted it.
REASONING,"Kishan Lal 's inaction over these years with full knowledge of the facts, as is evident from the deposition of D.W. 2, Dhiyan Singh, whose testimony is uncontradicted, and his acceptance of the estate with all its consequential benefits, unquestionably creates an estoppel in him."
REASONING,"This witness tells us that 488 ""Kishanlal always accepted this award and acted upon it."
REASONING,""" He qualifies this in cross examination by saying that Kishan Lal had also objected to it but the witness did not know whether that was before or after Mst."
REASONING,"The documents filed show it was after, so there is no reason why the main portion of his statement which is uncontradicted, and which could have been contradicted, should not be accepted."
REASONING,"Mohan Dei 's son Shri Kishan Das died and Kishan Lal thereupon became the next presumptive reversioner, and in October, 1929, when the reversion opened out the estate vested in him, or rather would have vested in him but for the estoppel."
REASONING,"The question therefore is, did he continue to be bound by the estoppel when he assumed a new character on the opening out of the reversion ? We have no doubt he did."
PRECEDENT,"The decision of the Judicial Committee which we have just cited, Kanhai Lal vs Brijlal(1), is, we think, clear on that point."
PRECEDENT,Although other reversioners who do not claim through the one who has consented are not bound.
PRECEDENT,the consenting reversioner is estopped.
PRECEDENT,This is beyond dispute when there is an alienation by a limited owner without legal necessity.
PRECEDENT,"See Ramgouda Annagouda vs Bhausaheb (2) where the ground of decision was "". .but"
PRECEDENT,Annagouda himself being a party to and benefiting by the transaction evidenced thereby was preclud ed from questioning any part of it.
PRECEDENT,""" In our opinion, the same principles apply to a case of the present kind."
PRECEDENT,"It was contended, however, on the strength of Rangasami Gounden vs Nachiappa Gounden(3) and Mr. Binda Kuer vs Lalitha Prasad(4), that even if Kishan Lal did take posses sion in 1889or 1890 on the strength of a title derived from his father, that would not have precluded him from asserting his own rights in a different character when the succession opened (1)(1918) 45 I.A 118."
PRECEDENT,(2) (1927) 54 I.A. 396 at 403.
PRECEDENT,(3) (1919) 46 I.A. 72.
PRECEDENT,(4) (1936) A.I.R. 1936 P.C. 304 at 308.
PRECEDENT,489 out.
PRECEDENT,Reliance in particular was placed upon page 808 of the latter ruling.
RPC,"In our opinion, that decision is to be distinguished."
PRECEDENT,In that case the reversion did not fall in till 1916.
PRECEDENT,"Long before that, namely in 1868, the next presumptive reversioners entered into a compromise whereby the grandfa ther of one Jairam who figured in that case obtained a good deal more than he Would have been entitled to in the ordi nary way."
PRECEDENT,"But for the compromise this grandfather would have got only one anna 12 gundas share, whereas due to the compromise he got as much as 2 annas 4 gundas, The actual taking of possession was however deferred under the compro mise till the death of one Anandi Kuer."
PRECEDENT,She died in 1885 and on that date Jairam was entitled to his grandfather 's share as both his father and grandfather were dead.
PRECEDENT,Jairam accordingly reaped the benefit of the transaction.
PRECEDENT,But it is to be observed that the extra benefit which he derived was only as to a 12 gundas share because he had an absolute and indefeasible right to 1 anna 12 gundas in any event in his own right under a title which did not spring from the com promise.
PRECEDENT,Jairam lost 1 anna 4 gundas to a creditor Munniram and out of the one anna which he had left from the 2 annas 4 gundas he sold 13 gundas to the plaintiffs for a sum of Rs. 500.
PRECEDENT,Now it is evident that on those facts it is impossible to predicate that the 13 gundas which the plaintiffs pur chased came out of the extra 12 gundas which Jairam obtained because of the compromise rather than out of the 1 anna 12 gundas to which he had a good and independent title anyway; and of course unless the plaintiffs ' 13 gundas could be assigned with certainty to the 12 gundas it would be impos sible to say that they had obtained any benefit from the compromise.
PRECEDENT,The Judicial Committee also added that even if it was possible to assign this 13 gundas with certainty to the 12 gundas it by no means followed that the plaintiffs admitted that fact nor would that necessarily have given them a benefit under the compromise.
PRECEDENT,They had the right to contest 'the 490 position and gamble on the possibility of being able to prove the contrary.
PRECEDENT,"Their Lordships added "" Unless the plaintiffs ' individual conduct makes it unjust that they should have a place among Bajrangi Lal 's reversioners their legal rights should have effect."
PRECEDENT,""" In the other case, Rangasami Gounden vs Nachiappa Goun den(1), their Lordships ' decision about this matter turned on the same sort of point: see page 87."
PRECEDENT,The present case is very different.
PRECEDENT,"When Kishan Lal took possession of his father 's property he held by virtue of the award and under no other title, and for forty years he continued to derive benefit from it."
PRECEDENT,"Accordingly, he would have been estopped even if he had claimed in a differ ent character as reversioner after the succession opened out."
PRECEDENT,"It was conceded that if the estoppel against Kishan Lal enured after October 1929, then the plaintiffs, who claim through Kishan Lal, would also be estopped."
RPC,The appeal succeeds.
RPC,The decree of the High Court is set aside and that of the first Court dismissing the plaintiffs ' claim is restored.
RPC,Costs here and in the High Court will be borne by the plaintiffs respondents.
RPC,Appeal allowed.
NAME,"Commissioner Of Police, Bombay vs Gordhandas Bhanji on 23 November, 1951"
CITATION,"Equivalent citations: 1952 AIR 16, 1952 SCR 135"
COUNSEL,"C.K. Daphtary, Solicitor General for Indict (G. N. Joshi, with him)for the appellant."
COUNSEL,"N.C. Chatterjee (R. M. Hajarnavis, with him) for the respondent."
JUDGE,The Judgment of the Court was delivered by BOSE J.
FACTS,"The respondent, Gordhandas Bhanji, wanted to build a cinema house on a plot of land at Andheri in the year 1945."
FACTS,At that date Andheri did not form a part of Bombay and under the.
FACTS,rules then in force it was necessary to obtain permis sion from the District Magistrate of that area in the form of a No Objection Certificate.
FACTS,"Accordingly, the respondent made the necessary application on the 12th of September, 1945."
FACTS,"Permission.was refused on the 30th of September, 1945, on the ground that the public of the locality objected and also because there was already one cinema theatre at Andheri and so it was not necessary to have another ""for the present."
FACTS,""" On the 1st of October, 1945, Andheri became a part of Greater Bombay and the jurisdiction to grant or refuse a license was transferred to the Commissioner of Police, Bombay."
FACTS,"The respondent accordingly put in a second applica tion on the 21st of November, 1945, and 138 addressed it to the Commissioner of Police."
FACTS,"After some correspondence this was also turned down on the 19th of March, 1946, ""owing to public opposition."
FACTS,""" Nothing daunted, the respondent applied again on the 1st of April, 1946, and asked for a ""reopening"" of his case."
FACTS,"One of the grounds given was that ""The Government of Bombay are giving very careful atten tion and affording all reasonable facilities to develop the Greater Bombay into a model one."
FACTS,"A modern cinema, there fore, of the type I propose to build is indispensable."
FACTS,""" In view of that, not unnaturally, the Commissioner of Police appears to have consulted the Government of Bombay, for he wrote to the respondent on the 25th of April, 1946, saying that ""the whole question of considering and approving sites for cinemas is under the consideration of the Government of Bombay,"" and he promised that ""when a decision is arrived at, your application will be examined."
FACTS,""" It seems that somewhere about this time a Cinema Adviso ry Committee was constituted by Government."
FACTS,We have not been enlightened about the scope and extent of its powers but it is evident from its nomenclature that its functions were purely advisory.
FACTS,"Five members of this Committee appear to have inspected the site on the 12th of May, 1947, and after prolonged discussion they reached the conclusion that ""in view of the location of four schools near by the site, this site is unsuitable for the purpose required and therefore it should be rejected."
FACTS,""" A note was drawn up to that effect and the matter was ordered to be placed on the agenda of the next meeting of the Committee ""for final decision."" This final decision has not been placed on record but the Commissioner of Police tells us in his affidavit that within a month the Committee advised that the application should be granted."
FACTS,"Accordingly, the Commissioner accorded the necessary permission by his 139 letter dated the 14/16th of July, 1947."
FACTS,There is no refer ence here to the recommendations of the Advisory co Commit tee and.
FACTS,"though they may have weighed, and rightly, with the Commissioner there is nothing on the face of the letter to indicate that the decision was not that of the Commis sioner himself given in bona fide exercise of the discretion vested in him."
RLC,"We refer to this because the Commissioner has stated in his affidavit that I was fully satisfied that the petitioner 's application should be refused, but that it was only at the instance of the Cinema Advisory Committee that I granted the said per mission on the 14th of July, 1947."
FACTS,There is no suggestion that his will was overborne or that there was dishonesty or fraud in what he did.
FACTS,"In the absence of that, he was entitled to take into consideration the advice thus tendered to him by a public body set up for this express purpose, and he was entitled in the bona fide exercise of his discretion to accept that advice and act upon it even though he would have acted differently if this important factor had not been present to his mind when he reached a decision."
FACTS,"The sanction accorded on the 16th of July, 1947, was therefore a good and valid sanction."
FACTS,"This sanction occasioned representations to Government presumably by the ""public"" who were opposing the scheme."
FACTS,"Anyway, the Commissioner wrote to the respondent on the 19/20th September, 1947, and direct him ""not to proceed with the construction of the cinema pending Government orders."" Shortly after, on the 27/30th September, 1947, the Commissioner sent the respondent the following communica tion: ""I am directed by Government to inform you that the permission to erect a cinema at the above site granted to you under this office letter. dated the 16th July, 1947, is hereby cancelled."
FACTS,""" 140 It will be necessary at this stage to determine whether this was a cancellation by the Commissioner of on his own authority acting in the exercise of some power which was either vested in him or of which he bona fide believed himself to be possessed, or whether he merely acted as a post office in forwarding orders issued by some other au thority."
FACTS,"We have no hesitation in reaching the conclusion that this is not an order of cancellation by the Commission er but merely intimation by him of an order passed and made by another authority, namely the Government of Bombay."
FACTS,An attempt was made by referring to the Commissioner 's affidavit to show that this was really an order of cancella tion made by him and that the order was his.order and not that of Government.
REASONING,"We are clear that public orders, public ly made, in exercise of a statutory authority cannot be construed in the light of explanations subsequently given by the officer making the order of what he meant, or of what was in his mind, or what he intended to do."
REASONING,Public orders made by public authorities are meant to have public effect and are intended to affect the acting and conduct of those to hum they are addressed and must be construed objectively with reference to the language used in the order itself.
REASONING,"Turning now to the language used, we are clear that by no stretch of imagination can this be construed to be an order which in effect says : ""I, so and so, by virtue of the authority vested in me, do hereby order and direct this and that."
REASONING,""" If the Commissioner of Police had the power to cancel the license already grant ed and was the proper authority to make the order, it was incumbent on him to say so in express and direct terms."
REASONING,"Public authorities cannot play fast and loose with the powers vested in them, and persons to whose detriment orders are made are entitled to know with exactness and precision what they are expected to do or forbear from doing and exactly what authority is making the order."
REASONING,141 But if there is ambiguity or doubt in the language used here a glance at the surrounding circumstances will dispel it.
REASONING,"What was the position at the time ? Permission was first refused and then granted, then suspended and the respondent was told to await, not the Commissioner 's orders, but those of Government."
REASONING,Then comes the letter in question which conveys those orders.
REASONING,So also there is the conduct of the Commissioner not long after.
REASONING,The respondent 's solicitors placed the same construction on the order of the 30th Sep tember as we do and asked the Commissioner how Government could interfere with a permission granted by him.
REASONING,"They said on the 18th November 1947 : ""Our client has been advised that the authority to grant permission is in you acting in consultation with the Adviso ry Board."
REASONING,"It is difficult to understand how the Government can interfere with the permission granted by you."" The Commissioner 's reply dated 3/4th December, 1947, was: ""I write to inform you that permission granted to your client was cancelled under the orders of the Government who may be approached. "" We are clear that this roundabout language would not have been used if the order of cancellation had been that of the Commissioner."
REASONING,"We do not mean to suggest that it would have been improper for him to take into consideration the views and wishes of Government provided he did not surrender his own judgment and provided he made the order, but we hold on the material before us that the order of cancellation came from Government and that the Commissioner acted only as a transmitting agent."
REASONING,It is next necessary to determine whether the Government of Bombay had the power to cancel a license once issued.
REASONING,That depends on a consideration of the Rules.
REASONING,"They are framed under section 22 (1) (f) (i) (g) and (h) of the City of Bombay Police Act, 1902."
REASONING,"They regulate the ""licensing, controlling, keeping and regulation"" of places."
REASONING,of public amusement in 19 142 the City of.
REASONING,Bombay.
REASONING,"Rule 8 applies to any person desirous of ""erecting""a cinema, building."
REASONING,"There is, in our opinion, a distinction of principles between the erection and use of buildings for purely private and residential purposes and those intended to be used as places of public amusement."
REASONING,"Considerations arise regarding the latter which would not be applicable to the former, among them the right to withdraw or modify a license once issued."
REASONING,"Ordinarily, a man can do what he likes with his property subject of course to specific laws regulating his use of it, there fore in the case of a private residence he would in a general way have a right to build if he complies with all the rules and regulations and restrictions which may be imposed by law, and if permission is withheld when all the conditions are fulfilled he would normally have a right to demand that the necessary permission be given."
REASONING,But that sort of consideration does not apply to a place intend ed to be used for public performances.
REASONING,"There, questions affecting the safety, convenience, morality and welfare of the public must be given overriding precedence and it is.usual in these cases, on grounds of public concern, to vest some public authority with a discretion to grant or refuse such licences and to modify or cancel ones already granted."
REASONING,"It is necessary to bear this distinction in mind when construing the present rules. 'Therefore, when Rule 8 speaks of ""erecting"" such premises, it must be borne in mind that the rule is not a mere building rule affecting the erection of a building in the abstract but applies to a building intended to be used for a particular purpose and the license applied for is not merely for permission to build but also to use structure, when erected, for a partic ular purpose affecting the public at large and the residents of the locality in particular."
REASONING,"Rule 8 falls under Part II which is headed : ""Preliminaries to obtaining license for premises."
REASONING,""" These preliminaries include (a) the making of an application in writing to the Commis sioner of Police, and 143 (b)the giving of a certain notice as a preliminary to the application."
REASONING,"This notice has to be in the form prescribed in Schedule A and has to be maintained on a certain board ""until the application has been dealt with by the Com missioner"" and the rule prescribes that "" no application shall be considered before the expira tion of one fortnight after the receipt by the Commissioner of a copy of the notice etc."
REASONING,""" Schedule A shows 'that the object of the notice is to enable the Commissioner to receive objections to the pro posed erection."
REASONING,The rest of the rules in Part II specify the matters which the application shall contain and the documents which must accompany it including plans and specifications of the proposed building.
REASONING,Part III prescribes various structural details with which the building must conform.
REASONING,"They include fire resist ing material for the roof, stage staircases and dressing rooms of a certain type, seating arrangements, Corridors, exits and so forth."
REASONING,This part of the rules would apply to a building already in existence but not yet licensed for public performance as well as to one which has yet to be erected.
REASONING,"Part IV relates to the ""Use of cinematograph Apparatus and other optical Lan terns."
REASONING,""" The rules prescribed there are mainly for purposes of health and safety."
REASONING,Parts V and VI do not concern us.
REASONING,They prescribe spe cial rules for Circuses and for exhibitions of Boxing and Wrestling.
REASONING,Then comes Part VII which is material for present pur poses.
REASONING,"It is headed ""Licenses""."
REASONING,"Rule 237 prescribes that ""The person being the owner, tenant or occupier of such premises and the person who proposes to give any public performance, entertainment or exhibition on 144 such premises shall each take out a license under these rules"" Then follows a sub heading ""Licenses for Premises"" and under that come Rules 238 to 257."
REASONING,"Rule 23S prescribes that : ""No such premises shall be opened, or kept open for use as a place of public amusement unless the person being the owner, tenant or occupier thereof shall have obtained from the Commissioner the necessary license."
REASONING,""" Rule 248 invests the Commissioner with ""absolute discretion in refusing any license etc. if such place appears to him likely to cause obstruction, inconvenience, annoyance, risk, danger or damage to resi dents or passers by in the vicinity of such premises."
REASONING,""" Then follows Rule 250 which is crucial here."
REASONING,"It says : ""The commissioner shall have power in his absolute dis cretion at any time to cancel or suspend any license granted under these Rules. "" After Rule 257 comes a second sub heading entitled ""Per formance License"" and Rules 258 to 28:3 set out the require ments relating to the holding of performances as distinct from the requirements relating to the building or premises in or on which they are to be held."
REASONING,The rest of the rules do not concern us.
REASONING,It is clear to us from a perusal of these rules that the only person vested with authority to grant or refuse a license for the erection of a building to be used for pur poses of public amusement is the Commissioner of Police.
REASONING,It is also clear that under Rule 250 he has been vested with the absolute discretion at any time to cancel or suspend any license which has been granted under the rules.
REASONING,But the power to do so is vested in him and not in the State Govern ment and can only be exercised by him at his discretion.
REASONING,No other person or authority can do it.
REASONING,It was argued that Rule 250 did not apply to licenses to erect buildings but only referred to other matters 145 such as their maintenance and the kind of performances to be given in them.
REASONING,We are unable to agree.
REASONING,"The preamble to the rules states that the Rules are for the ""licensing, controlling, keeping and regulation"" of places of public amusement in the City Bombay."
REASONING,Part II which deals with the erection cinema houses nowhere autho rises the issue of a license but it does indicate that a license is necessary.
REASONING,"For instance, the heading states that the rules which follow in Part II are only the ""prelimi naries to obtaining license for premises"" and Rule 21 sets out that ""Before a license is granted. for such premises"" certain certificates must be produced."
REASONING,All of which indi cates that a license is necessary.
REASONING,"But the only provision the actual issue of the license is in Part VII, and Rules 237 and 238 in that part require the owner, tenant or occu pier of premises intended to be used for a cinema house for public amusement to take out a license as well as for the person who proposes to give a public performance on such premises."
REASONING,"In our opinion, Rule 250 does authorise the can cellation of a license already issued but the only person who can effect the cancellation is the Commissioner of Police."
REASONING,It was contended that this would work great hardship in some cases and that if money had already been expended on the building an estoppel at least would arise.
REASONING,"No question of estoppel has been raised here, so that is not a question we need consider nor need we answer the converse question whether an estoppel would hold good in the face of a law enacted for the public good on grounds of public policy; also whether there can be an estoppel when a person builds knowing the risk he runs of cancellation at any time under Rule 2S0."
REASONING,The next question is whether an order in the nature of a mandamus can issue under section 45 of the Specific Relief Act.
REASONING,It is necessary to emphasise that the present case does not fall either under article 32 (2) or article 226(1) of the Constitution.
REASONING,We are confined here to section 45 of the Specific Relief Act.
REASONING,"146 The jurisdiction,conferred by."
REASONING,that section is very spe cial in kind and is strictly limited in extent though the am but of the powers exercisable within those limited is wide.
REASONING,"Among the limitations imposed are the following: First, the order can only direct some specific act to be done or some specific ,act to be forborne."
REASONING,It is not possible therefore to give a mere declaratory relief as under section 42.
REASONING,"Next, because of the proviso, the order can only be made if the doing or the for bearing is clearly recumbent upon the authority concerned under any law for the time being in force."
REASONING,"And thirdly, there must be no other specific and adequate legal remedies available to the applicant."
REASONING,"Now applying these rules to the present case, the appli cant must show what specific act he wants to."
REASONING,be done or to be forborne.
REASONING,That can only be gathered from the petition.
REASONING,The reliefs specifically sought there are (1) an order directing the Commissioner to withdraw the cancellation and/or (2) directing him to grant permission for the erec tion of a cinema.
REASONING,Taking the second.
REASONING,"first, it is evident from the rules that there is no specific law which requires the Commission er to grant a license on the fulfillment by the petitioner of certain conditions."
REASONING,He is vested with a discretion to grant or to refuse a license and all that the law requires is that he should exercise that discretion in good faith.
REASONING,But that he has done.
REASONING,"In the exercise of that discretion he granted a license and that license still holds good because, on the view we have taken, there has been no valid order of cancellation."
REASONING,"Accordingly, this relief cannot be granted."
REASONING,"Turning next to the first relief, that cannot be grant ed in the form in which it is sought because the rules vest the Commissioner with an absolute discretion to cancel at any time a license once granted."
REASONING,There is no specific law which compels him to forbear from canceling a license once granted in fact that would be an impossibility; still less is there any law which compels him to withdraw a cancella tion already effected: that would fetter the absolute dis cretion 147 vested in him by Rule 250.
REASONING,"Therefore, this relief cannot be granted in the way it is asked for."
REASONING,But we are of opinion that we are free to grant the respondent a modification of that relief in a different form.
REASONING,"It is to be observed that the petitioner did ask that he be granted ""such further and other relief as the nature and circumstances of the case may require."
REASONING,""" We have held that the Commissioner did not in fact exercise his discretion in this case and did not cancel the license he granted."
REASONING,He merely forwarded to the respondent an order of cancellation which another authority had pur ported to pass.
REASONING,It is evident from these facts that the Commissioner had before him objections which called for the exercise of the discretion regarding cancellation specifi cally vested in him by Rule 250.
REASONING,He was therefore bound to exercise it and bring to bear on the matter his own inde pendent and unfettered judgment and decide for himself whether to cancel the license or reject the objections.
REASONING,That duty he can now be ordered to perform under section 45.
REASONING,It was objected as to this that there is no specific law which compels him to exercise the discretion.
REASONING,Rule 250 merely vests a discretion in him but does not require him to exercise it.
PRECEDENT,"That is easily met by the observations of Earl Cairns L.C. in the House of Lords in Julius vs Lord Bishop of Oxford(i), observations which have our full and respect ful concurrence : ""There may be something in the nature of the thing empowered to be done, something in the object for which it is to be done, something in the conditions under which it is to be done, something in the title of the person or persons for whose benefit the power is to be exercised, which may couple the power with a duty, and make it the duty of the person in whom the power is reposed, to exercise that power when called upon to do so."
REASONING,""" The discretion vested in the Commissioner of Police under Rule 250 has been conferred upon him for public rea sons involving the convenience, safety, (1) 5 App."
REASONING,"214 at 222, 223."
REASONING,148 morality and welfare.
REASONING,of the public at large.
REASONING,"An ena bling power of this kind conferred for public reasons and for the public benefit is, in our opinion, coupled with a duty to exercise it when the circumstances so demand."
REASONING,It is a duty which cannot be shirked or shelved nor can it be evaded; performance of it can be compelled under section 45.
REASONING,It was then objected that performance cannot be com pelled for another reason.
REASONING,"Section 45, it was said, is limited to duties which must be performed or forborne ""under any law for the time being in force,"" and it was argued that this means statute law."
REASONING,"There is authority for this point of view, but we see no reason for limiting the clear words of the section or for reading into it matter which is not there."
REASONING,The provision is a beneficent one to compel the performance of public duties by public officers.
REASONING,"It is intended to open up a swift and summary remedy to the subject against, on the one hand, certain kinds of abuse or excesses on the part of public officers or, on the other, of laziness, incompetence, inertia or inaction on their part."
REASONING,"We can see no reason why statutory duties should be placed on any different plane from other duties enjoined by any other kind of law, especially as some."
REASONING,statutory duties are slight or trivial when compared to certain other kinds of duties which are not referable to a statutory provision.
REASONING,"In our opinion, the words ""any law"" are wide enough to embrace all kinds of law and we so hold."
REASONING,"The only other point we need consider is whether ""the applicant has no other specific and adequate legal remedy."
REASONING,""" It was contended on behalf of the appellant that the re spondent could have ignored the so called order of cancella tion if he considered it was of no effect; alternatively, he had the specific legal remedy of suing for an injunction which could have accorded him adequate relief."
REASONING,In our opinion.
REASONING,the first is neither a specific nor an adequate legal remedy.
REASONING,Here is an order purporting to 149 emanate from the State Government itself served on the respondent by a responsible public officer.
REASONING,"Whether, the order is his order or an order of the State Government it is obviously one which primarily compels obedience as a matter of prudence and precaution."
REASONING,"It may in the end prove to be ineffective, as has happened in this case, but it would be wrong to expect a person on whom it is served to ignore it at his peril however much he may be legally entitled to do so."
REASONING,"Also, the very fact that this order was served on him, especially when it followed on the Commissioner 's letter of the 19/20th September, 1947, indicated that objections of a serious nature which it was the Commissioner 's duty to consider had been raised."
REASONING,"The respondent had a right to expect the Commissioner to make up his mind and reach a decision, otherwise it left him in a state of uncertainty."
REASONING,"If he commenced to build, the Commissioner would have a right to take action under Rule 250 and tell him to stop, and at best that would involve the respondent in a long and expensive litigation which he might or might not win."
REASONING,"We are clear that he had a right to be told definitely by the proper legal authority exactly what he might or might not do, so that he could adjust his affairs."
REASONING,We are clear that the dangerous course of ignoring an official order at one 's peril is not the kind of adequate and specific legal remedy contemplated by section 45.
REASONING,"Next, as regards the relief of injunction."
REASONING,We do not say that would not be a proper and adequate remedy in certain cases.
REASONING,Each case must necessarily depend on its own facts and we have no intention of laying down any hard and fast rule.
REASONING,But we do not think that would be adequate to meet the exigencies of the present case.
REASONING,"In the first place, a suit, if lodged, would require notice under section 80 of the Civil Procedure Code as it would be a suit against a public officer in his official capacity, and that would at once import delay; so would the long drawn out procedure of civil litigation with its concomitant appeals."
REASONING,"In a commer cial undertaking of the kind we have here, inordinate delay might well spell ruin to the project."
REASONING,"Large sums of money have necessarily to be tied up 20 150 so long as the matter remains in abeyance, the prices of land and materials are constantly rising and there is in the vicinity a rival theater which is all the while acquiring reputation and goodwill, two undefinable but important considerations in commercial undertakings."
REASONING,"It is therefore desirable that questions of the kind we have here should be decided as soon as may be It may be that any one of those considerations taken separately might not be enough to fulfil this requirement of section 45, but considered cumu latively we are of opinion that the applicant has no other adequate remedy in tiffs case."
REASONING,"In any event, there are many cases of a similar nature in which section 45 has been applied without objection despite the fact that an injunc tion could have been sought."
REASONING,"We need only cite a decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (A1cock, Ashdown & Co. vs Chief Revenue Authority, Bombay) (1) where Lord Phillimore says at page 233 : ""To argue that if the Legislature says that a public officer, even a revenue officer, shall do a thing, and he without cause or justification refuses to do that thing, yet the Specific Relief Act would not be applicable, and there would be no power in the Court to compel him to give relief to the subject, is to state a proposition to which their Lordships must refuse assent."" Their Lordships then issued an order under section 45."
REASONING,"Lastly, it was urged that the petition is incompetent because the provisions of section 46 of the Specific Relief Act have not been complied with, namely, the petitioner has not shown that he made a demand for justice and that it was denied."
REASONING,The demand and denial which section 46 requires are matters of substance and not of form.
REASONING,"In our opinion, there was a substantial demand here and it is clear that there was a denial."
REASONING,Soon after the order of cancellation was intimat ed to the petitioner he instructed his solicitors to write to the Commissioner and enquire (1) 50 I.A. 227 at 233.
REASONING,151 why the permission granted had been so arbitrarily can celled.
REASONING,"This was on the 18th November, 1947."
REASONING,"The reply dated 3/4th December, 1947, was that the cancellation was under the orders of Government and that they should be approached in the matter."
REASONING,Government was approached.
ARG,"The petitioner 's solicitors wrote to the Home Minister on the 9th December, 1947, and said : ""Our client has not been informed of any reasons which had moved the Government to direct the cancellation of the permission."
ARG,Our client was really entitled to be heard in the matter.
ARG,"Our client desires to present his case before you and he shall feel obliged if you give him an interview. "" The Secretary to the Home Department replied on the 12th of January, 1948, that the Commissioner was directed to cancel the permission in view of numerous protests which Government received."
ARG,"This was replied to on the 16th of February, 1948, and the petitioner 's solicitors said : ""Our client feels that he has not been treated fairly and that justice has been denied to him."" The only reply to this was : ""I am directed to inform you that Government does not wish to add anything to the reply already given to you."" The correspondence read as a whole contains a clear demand for justice and a denial."
REASONING,"It is true the actual demand was not made to the Commissioner nor was the denial by him but he clearly washed his hands of the matter by his letter of the 3rd/4th December, 1947, and referred the petitioner to Government under whose orders he said he was acting."
REASONING,The demand made to Government and the denial by them were therefore in substance a demand made to the Commission er and a denial by him.
REASONING,"In any event, an evasion or shelving,of a demand for justice is sufficient to operate as a denial within the meaning of section 46."
REASONING,In England the refusal need not be in so many words All that is necessary is to 152 show that the party complained of has distinctly deter mined not to do what.
REASONING,"is demanded (See 9 Halsbuy 's Laws of Eng land, Hailsham edition, page 772)."
REASONING,"And in the United States of America a demand is not required ""where it is manifest it would be but an idle ceremony"" (See Ferris on Extraordinary Legal Remedies, page 281)."
REASONING,The law in India is not differ ent except that there must be a demand and a denial in substance though neither need be made in so many words The requirements of section 46 were therefore fulfilled.
REASONING,"The result is that in substance"" the appeal fails though it will be necessary to effect a modification of the High Court 's order."
REASONING,"The High Court directed the Commissioner of police to ""Withdraw the order of cancellation passed by him."
REASONING,""" We have held that he did not make the order and that even if he did, a direction of that sort would not lie because of the discretion vested in him by Rule 250."
RPC,"The following will accordingly be substituted for what the High Court has ordered: The Commissioner of Police be directed to consider the requests made to him for cancellation of the license sanc tioned by his letter dated the 14/16th of July, 1947, and, after weighing all the different aspects of the matter, and after bringing to bear his own unlettered judgment on the subject, himself to issue a definite and unambiguous order either canceling or refusing to cancel the said license in the exercise of the absolute discretion vested in him by Rule 250 of the Rules for Licensing and Controlling Theaters and Other Places of Public Amusement in Bombay City, 1914."
RPC,"As the appeal fails except for the slight modification indicated above, the appellant will pay the respondent 's costs."
RPC,Decree modified.

COUNSEL,"M.C. Setalvad, Attorney General for India, (Nandial Untwalia, with him) for the appellant."
COUNSEL,"B. C. De (Jyotirmoy Ghose, with him) for the respondent."
JUDGE,The Judgment of the Court was deliv ered by MUKHERJEA J.
FACTS,"This appeal is on behalf of the defendant and it arises out of a suit commenced by the plaintiff respondent, in the Court of the Subordinate Judge at Chai bassa, for recovery of possession of the land described in schedule to the plaint, on the allegation that the defendant was a monthly tenant in respect of the same, and that the tenancy was determined by a notice to quit."
FACTS,"The suit was decreed by the trial court and the decision was affirmed, on appeal, by the District Judge, Purulia, and on Second Ap peal, by a Division Bench of the High Court of Patna."
FACTS,"The defendant has now come up to this court on the strength of a certificate granted under section 110, Civil Procedure Code."
FACTS,"Mr. Setalvad, appearing on behalf of the defendant appellant, stated to us at the outset that he would not dispute the validity or sufficiency of the notice to quit served upon his client, if on the facts of this case he is held to be a monthly tenant under the plaintiff in respect of the premises in suit."
FACTS,"His contention, in substance, is that the defendant was at no point of time a monthly tenant under the plaintiff or his predecessor."
FACTS,"There might have been, according to the learned Counsel, two tenancies for one year each for two successive periods, but on the expiry of the second yearly lease, which happened on 7th December, 1926, the defendant ceased to be a tenant and no fresh tenancy was created by holding over as is contemplated by section 116 of the Transfer of Property Act."
FACTS,"As there was no holding over, there could not be any question of a monthly tenancy being brought into existence 272 under the provision of section 116 of the Transfer of Property Act, and the present suit of the plaintiff having been admittedly brought more than 12 years after the deter mination of the second yearly lease, is barred by limitation under Article 139 of the Indian Limitation Act."
FACTS,The whole controversy in this appeal thus centres round the point as to whether the defendant was in fact a monthly tenant under the plaintiff at the date when the notice to quit was served upon him.
FACTS,"To appreciate the respective contentions that have been put forward upon this point by the learned Counsel on both sides, it will be necessary to narrate briefly the material facts in their chronological order."
FACTS,"The property in suit is a plot of land, measuring 4 bighas 12 cuttas, and is comprised in old Survey plot No. 578 of village Jugselai in the district of Singhbhum."
FACTS,"The entire village forms part of the Dhalbhum estate, of which the plaintiff is admittedly the present proprietor."
FACTS,"One Charan Bhumiji was the "" Prodhan"" of village Jugselai from some time before 1913 and on 24th July, 1913, the father of the defendant, by a registered Patta, took a lease of about :31 bighas of land appertaining to Survey plot No. 573 from this Prodhan for purposes of cultivation."
FACTS,It is not disput ed that the property in suit is covered by this Patta.
FACTS,"At that time the proprietor of the Dhalbhum estate was Raja Satrughna and he died in 1916, leaving behind him a will by which the entire estate was bequeathed to the present plain tiff."
ARG,The plaintiff 's claim under the will was challenged by one Partap Chandra Deo Dhabal who succeeded in getting his name recorded as proprietor of the zemindari in the Singhbhum Collectorate.
FACTS,Thereupon the plaintiff instituted a suit (being Title Suit No. 67 of 1921) in the Court of the Subordinate Judge at Midnapore for establishment of his title to the zemindari and the suit was decreed by the trial Judge.
FACTS,"Against this decision, the defendant Pratap Chandra Deo Dhabal took an appeal to the High Court of Calcutta and during the pendency of this appeal, the High Court appointed a Receiver who was put in 273 possession of the entire estate."
FACTS,"On 8th December, 1924, the defendant executed a registered Kabuliyat in favour of the Receiver, by which he purported to take settlement of the land in suit for a period of 10 years at a rental of Rs. 46 per annum and a selami of Rs. 250."
FACTS,"There was a covenant in the lease, which looks like one for perpetual renewal, and it was to the effect that on the expiry of the term, if the lessor did not require the land for his own purposes and decided to re settle it, the lessee would be entitled to fresh settlement on enhanced,rent and on such terms as might be then agreed upon between the parties."
FACTS,"It appears from the record that the selami money, amounting to Rs. 250, was paid by the defendant to the Receiver several months before the Kabuliyat was executed, and the rental amounting to Rs. 46 was paid for the first time on 8th of March, 1925."
FACTS,"The next payment of rent was made in the succeeding year, on 16th of March, 1926."
FACTS,"Admittedly, no further payment of rent was made by the lessee either to the Receiver or to the proprietor since then, up to this period."
RLC,The High Court dismissed the appeal preferred by Pratap Chandra Deo Dhabal some time in 1924 and this order of dismissal was affirmed by the Judi cial Committee in May 1927.
FACTS,The Receiver was then dis charged and the plaintiff got possession of the entire estate in July 1927.
FACTS,"On April 15, 1937, the plaintiff brought a suit for ejectment (being Title Suit No. 2 of 1937) against the defendant in respect of this property in the Court of the Subordinate Judge at Chaibassa."
FACTS,"The claim was based substantially upon the terms of the Kabuliyat executed by the defendant on 24th of December, 1924, and the suit was, in fact, one for ejectment of a lessee on the expiration of the period provided for in the lease."
FACTS,"It was only the renewal clause in the Kabuliyat that was challenged as invalid and inoperative, not only because it was vague and indefinite but also on the ground that the Receiver acted beyond his authority in entering into a stipulation of this character."
FACTS,36 274 The defendant in his written statement resisted the plaintiff 's claim for possession primarily on the ground that he had acquired permanent rights in the land under the Prodhan 's Patta of 1913 and continuous occupation of it since then for more than 12 years.
FACTS,"The Kabuliyat of 1924, he attempted to ignore altogether."
FACTS,"It was said that it was executed only to avoid trouble and harassment at the hands of the Receiver and that, being inoperative as a lease, it could not, in any view, affect the prior rights which he acquired under the Patta of 1913."
FACTS,The trial judge decreed the suit.
RLC,"On appeal, the judg ment was reversed by the District Judge and the plaintiff 's suit was dismissed simply on the ground that the notice to quit that was served on the defendant was ineffectual in law to determine the tenancy."
RLC,"The District Judge found, first of all, that the Prodhan 's Patta was void and inoperative in law and could not create any rights in the defendant, inas much as the Prodhan had no authority to settle lands of this character."
FACTS,The Kabuliyat of 1924 was also held to be inef fectual as not amounting to a lease as defined by the Trans fer of Property Act.
RLC,"It was held, however, by the District Judge that apart from the Kabuliyat, a tenancy was created by payment and acceptance of rent in the years 1925 and 1926 and after 1926 the defendant occupied the position of a monthly tenant by holding over under section 116 of the Transfer of Property Act."
FACTS,"Such tenancy could be determined by fifteen days ' notice, expiring with the month of tenancy, but as the notice, which was served by the plaintiff upon the defendant, did not fulfil this requirement, the plain tiff 's suit was bound to fail."
FACTS,"The District Judge, though he dismissed the suit, gave the plaintiff a declaration to the effect that the defendant was liable to eviction on service of fifteen days ' notice, expiring with the end of the Bengali month of the tenancy."
FACTS,"Against this decision, the plaintiff took an appeal to the High Court of Patna, and the appeal came up for hearing before Harries C.J. and Fazl Ali J."
FACTS,The learned Judges affirmed the finding of the lower appellate court that 275 the Prodhan 's Patta did not create any rights in the defend ant and that the Kabuliyat of 1924 was also ineffectual as a lease to give the defendant any tenancy right.
FACTS,The learned Judges further held that the defendant did not acquire any permanent right in the land by prescription or otherwise and that by reason of the payment of rent to the Receiver in the years 1925 and 1926 he became a tenant from month to month.
FACTS,In these circumstances the High Court con curred with the District Judge in holding that the notice to quit was insufficient for the purpose of determining the tenancy.
FACTS,"It seems that the defendant made a strenuous endeavour before the High Court to establish that as the Patta of 1913 as well as the Kabuliyat of 1924 were both invalid and inoperative, he was never a tenant in respect of the land in suit and no tenancy could be created by the two payments of rent, inasmuch as the Receiver had no authority to receive them."
FACTS,"It was contended, therefore, that the plaintiff was in possession of the land as a trespasser all along and thus acquired a good title by adverse possession."
FACTS,"The High Court, though it held definitely that the defendant was a tenant from month to month, nevertheless kept open the question as to whether the payment of rent to the Receiver was tantamount to payment to the plaintiff."
FACTS,"It was held that as the notice to quit was defective, that was suffi cient for dismissal of the suit, and the declaration made in the decree of the lower appellate court that the defendant was liable to be evicted on service of fifteen days ' notice, expiring with the Bengali month of the tenancy, was directed to be deleted."
FACTS,"This judgment of the High Court was pro nounced on the 5th of May, 1942."
FACTS,"Soon after this on 18th July, 1942, the plaintiff served a notice to quit on the defendant, asking him to vacate the land on the 7th of August following, and as the defendant refused to give up possession, the present suit was brought on 22nd July, 1943."
FACTS,The plaint in the present suit is a very simple one;it proceeds entirely on the findings record ed by the High Court in the previous litigation.
FACTS,The right to 276 possession is not based on the terms of the Kabuliyat of 1024.
FACTS,"The plaintiff avers that by reason of the payment of rent on 8th March, 1925, and 16th March, 1926 the defendant became a tenant from month to month under him and the tenan cy was determined by a proper notice to quit."
FACTS,The defendant in his written statement raised several pleas in answer to the plaintiff 's claim.
FACTS,"He reiterated his rights under the Patta of 1913 and urged that by reason of his holding possession of the land on assertion of a perma nent tenancy right for a long period of time, he acquired a valid title to the property."
FACTS,"As regards the Kabuliyat of 1924, it is said in one part of the written statement that the defendant executed this document under misapprehension of facts without knowing the contents thereof."
FACTS,"But at anoth er place it is stated that the Kabuliyat was binding on the plaintiff and he was not entitled to institute a suit in contravention of its terms, without in any event refunding the selami money."
FACTS,"The defendant admitted, what he denied in the earlier suit, that the payments made to the Receiver amounted to payments to the plaintiff himself, although this question was left open by the High Court on the previous occasion."
FACTS,"The other pleas raised in the written statement are not material, except that a specific point was taken, challenging the sufficiency of the notice to quit that was served upon the defendant."
FACTS,On these pleadings a number of issues were framed.
FACTS,The trial judge held on a consideration of the materials placed before him that the Prodhan 's Patta was a void and inopera tive document and conferred no rights on the defendant.
FACTS,"He negatived the case, which the defendant attempted to make in course of hearing, that the Kabuliyat executed by him was obtained by threat and coercion."
FACTS,"It was held by the Subordi nate Judge in accordance with the decisions of the Patna High Court on the point that the Kabuliyat could not operate as a lease under the Transfer of Property Act, and conse quently the defendant did not acquire the rights of a lessee under the same."
FACTS,"He held, however, 277 that by payment and acceptance of rent a new tenancy was created de hors the Kabuliyat, and as the new tenancy was for building purposes, it."
FACTS,"was a tenancy from month to month under section 106 Transfer of Property Act, terminable by fifteen days notice."
FACTS,"As the notice was proper and, suffi cient, the trial judge decreed the plaintiff 's suit."
FACTS,"Against this judgment, the defendant took an appeal to the court of the District Judge, Purulia, and the District Judge dismissed the appeal and affirmed the judgment of the trial court."
FACTS,It appears that two points were raised by the defend ant before the District Judge in support of his appeal: one was that the Kabuliyat of 1924 was effective as a lease and consequently the defendant could not be ejected in contra vention of the terms thereof.
FACTS,"At the same time it was con tended that there was no tenancy at all held by the defend ant under the plaintiff, inasmuch as the payments made to the Receiver could not be regarded as payments to the plain tiff."
FACTS,"The first point, the District Judge pointed out, was contrary to the express decisions of the Patna High Court, while the second was contradictory to the defendant 's own admission in the written statement."
FACTS,"The defendant then came up in Second Appeal before the High Court of Patna and the appeal was heard by a Division Bench, consisting of Shearer and Reuben JJ."
FACTS,"The learned Judges agreed in dismissing the appeal and affirming the decree made by the courts below, but the grounds upon which they based their decision are not identical."
FACTS,"As regards the nature of the tenancy created by implication of law in consequence of the Receiver having accepted payment of rent from the defendant, it was held by Reuben J. that when the Receiver accepted rent in 1925, it should be presumed that the parties intended to create a tenancy for one year and when he accepted rent again in 1926, such acceptance amount ed to his assenting to the defendant 's holding over; and in view of the purpose for which the tenancy was created, the defendant from that time became a tenant from 278 month to month under the provision of section 116, Transfer of Property Act."
FACTS,"Shearer, J., felt difficulty in accepting this view though in his opinion if a periodic tenancy was created at all, it was from month to month and not from year to year."
FACTS,"There are observations, however, in the latter part of the judgment of Shearer, J., which would go to show that in his opinion the creation of two leases, each for one year, could be fairly gathered from the admitted facts of the case."
REASONING,"The learned Judge was not sure, however, as to whether the defendant ever became a tenant of the plaintiff."
REASONING,He discussed the nature of the renewal clause contained in the Kabuliyat and held it to be void for uncertainty.
REASONING,He also negatived the defendant 's plea on the strength of adverse possession.
REASONING,"His conclusion was that whatever view might be taken regarding these points, the defendant had no valid defence to the plaintiff 's claim for eviction and consequently the decision of the courts below was right."
REASONING,It is the propriety of this decision that has been challenged before us in this appeal.
REASONING,"Mr. Setalvad, in support of his client 's case, has not called in aid the Prodhan 's Patta of 1913; nor has he placed any reliance upon the Kabuliyat of 1924 and the covenant for renewal contained therein."
REASONING,"He has not disputed before us that the payments made to the Receiver were in reality payments to the plaintiffs, and has conceded that a tenancy could be created by implication by reason of his client having paid and the Receiver having accepted rents in re spect of the suit premises."
REASONING,"His contention, as indicated already, is that by reason of the payment and acceptance of rent, there were two tenancies for one year each, creat ed for two successive years; but the relationship of landlord and tenant between the parties came to an end on the expiration of the second annual lease."
REASONING,"As there was no holding over by the defendant since then as contemplated by section 116, Transfer of Property Act, there was no subsist ing tenancy at any time after December, 1926, and the plain tiff 's suit instituted in the year 1943 was obviously time barred."
REASONING,"279 Mr. De, appearing for the plaintiff respondent, has, on the other hand, contended that the tenancy that was created by payment and acceptance of rent in the year 1925 was from the beginning a tenancy from month to month under the provi sion of section 106."
REASONING,Transfer of Property Act.
REASONING,"Alterna tively, he has argued that if a tenancy for one year only was created in the year 1925, then after the expiration of that one year 's lease the defendant held over and the Receiver 's assent to his continuing in possession is evidenced by acceptance of rent from him in the year 1926."
REASONING,"The tenancy thus created would be a tenancy from month to month under section 116, Transfer of Property Act."
REASONING,"Lastly, it is argued that even if two successive tenancies were created for one year each, the facts admitted and proved would go to show that the tenant held over after the second annual lease and consequently a tenancy from month to month came into existence in accordance with the provision of section 116, Transfer of Property Act, even though no rent was demanded by the landlord after 1926."
REASONING,"The contro versy between the parties so far as this appeal is con cerned, therefore, narrows down to the following three points : (1) What was the nature of the tenancy created by ac ceptance of rent by the Receiver from the defendant on the 8th of March, 1925 ? If it was a tenancy from month to month, it is not disputed on behalf of the defendant that no question of holding over would at all arise and the plain tiff would be entitled to succeed."
REASONING,"(2) If in 1925 a tenancy was created for one year, can the landlord 's assent to the defendant 's continuing in possession be inferred from the fact that rent was accepted from the defendant in March, 1926 ? (3) If the payment and acceptance of rent in March, 1926, brought into existence a tenancy for another year, was there any subsequent tenancy created after the second year, although there was no ,demand or acceptance of rent by the landlord since then ? 280 So far as the first point is concerned, the courts below have proceeded on the view that a registered instru ment signed by the landlord was necessary to create."
REASONING,a valid lease for ten years.
REASONING,That view was not questioned before us and we express no opinion on this point.
REASONING,"Proceeding, there fore, on the assumption that even though the parties might have intended to create a lease for 10 years, no operative ]ease came into existence, the only facts admitted are that the defendant remained in possession of the land belonging to the plaintiff with the permission of the Receiver who represented the plaintiff 's estate, and paid rent to the latter."
REASONING,"From these facts a tenancy could be fairly presumed and the point for determination is, what was the duration of the tenancy that was created in the present case? Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act lays down: ""In the absence of a contract or local law or usage to the contrary a lease of immovable property for agricultural or manufacturing purposes shall be deemed to be a lease from year to year, terminable, on the part of either lessor or lessee, by six months ' notice expiring with the end of a year of the tenancy; and a lease of immovable property for any other purpose shall be deemed to be a lease from month to month, terminable, on the part of either lessor or les see, by fifteen days ' notice expiring with the end of a month of tenancy."
REASONING,""" The section lays down a rule of construction which is to be applied when there is no period agreed upon between the parties."
REASONING,In such cases the duration has to be determined by reference to the object or purpose for which the tenancy is created.
REASONING,The rule of construction embodied in this sec tion applies not only to express leases of uncertain dura tion but also to leases implied by law which may be inferred from possession and acceptance of rent and other circum stances.
REASONING,It is conceded that in the case before us the tenancy was not for manufacturing or agricultural purposes.
REASONING,The object was to enable the lessee to build structures upon the land.
REASONING,"In these circumstances, it could be 281 regarded as a tenancy from month to month."
REASONING,unless there was a contract to the contrary.
REASONING,"The question now is, whether there was a contract to the contrary in the present case ? Mr. Setalvad relies very strongly upon the fact that the rent paid here was an annual rent and he argues that from this fact it can fairly be inferred that the agreement between the parties was certainly not to create a monthly tenancy."
REASONING,"It is not disputed that the contract to the con trary, as contemplated by section 106 of the Transfer of."
REASONING,"Property Act, need not be an express contract; it may be implied, but it certainly should be a valid contract."
REASONING,"If it is no contract in law, the section will be operative and regulate the duration of the lease."
REASONING,It has no doubt been recognised in several cases that the mode in which a rent is expressed to be payable affords a presumption that the tenancy is of a character corresponding there to.
REASONING,"Conse quently, when the rent reserved is an annual rent, the presumption would arise that the tenancy was an annual tenancy unless there is something to rebut the presumption."
REASONING,"But the difficulty in applying this rule to the present case arises from the fact that a tenancy from year to year or reserving a yearly rent can be made only by registered instrument, as laid down in section 107 of the Transfer of Property Act(1)."
REASONING,"The Kabuliyat in the case before us is undoubtedly a registered instrument, but ex concessis it is not an operative document at all and cannot consequently fulfil the requirements of section 107 of the Transfer of Property Act."
REASONING,"This position in fact is not seriously controverted by Mr. Setalvad; but what he argues is that a lease for one year certain might fairly be inferred from the payment of annual rent, and a stipulation like that would not come within the mischief of section 107 of the Transfer of Property Act."
REASONING,"His contention is that the payment of an annual rent, as was made in the present case, is totally inconsistent with a monthly lease."
PRECEDENT,"We are not unmindful of the fact that in (1) Vide Debendra Nath vs Syama Prasanna, , 1126 37 282 certain reported cases, such inference has been drawn."
PRECEDENT,"One such case has been referred to by Mr.Justice Reuben in his judgment(1), where reliance was placed upon an earlier decision of the Calcutta High CoUrt(3)."
REASONING,A similar view seems to have been taken also in Matilal vs Darjeeling Municipality(3).
REASONING,But one serious objection to this view seems to be that this would amount to making a new contract for the parties.
REASONING,The parties here certainly did not intend to create a lease for one year.
REASONING,"The lease was intended to be for a period exceeding one year, but as the intention was not expressed in the proper legal form, it could not be given effect to."
REASONING,"It is one thing to say that in the absence of a valid agreement, the rights of the parties would be regulat ed by law in the same manner as if no agreement existed at all; it is quite another thing to substitute a new agreement for the parties which is palpably contradicted by the admit ted facts of the case."
REASONING,"It would be pertinent to point out in tiffs connection that in the Second Appeal preferred by the plaintiff against the dismissal of his earlier suit by the lower appellate court, the High Court definitely held that the defendant 's tenancy was one from month to month under section 106, Transfer of Property Act, and the only question left open was whether payment to the Receiver amounted to payment to the plaintiff himself."
REASONING,"In this suit the defendant admitted in his written statement that payment to the Receiver had the same effect as payment to the plaintiff, and the trial judge took the same view as was taken by the High Court on the previous occasion, that by payment to and acceptance of rent by the Receiver, the defendant became a monthly tenant under section 106, Transfer of Property Act."
REASONING,"In his appeal before the District Judge, which was the last court of facts, the only ground upon which the defendant sought to challenge this finding of the trial judge was that the Receiver was an unauthorised person because of the 'decision of (1) Aziz Ahmad vs Alauddin Ahmad, A.I.R. 1933 Pat. 485."
PRECEDENT,(2) Md. Moosa vs Jaganund (3) 17 C.L.J. 167.
REASONING,283 the Judicial Committee which set aside his appointment and consequently acceptance of rent by such person could not create a monthly tenancy.
REASONING,"This shows that it was not the case of the defendant at any stage of this suit that because one year 's rent was paid, a tenancy for one year was brought into existence."
REASONING,"We think, therefore, that on the facts of this case it would be quite proper to hold that the tenancy of the defendant was one from month to month since its inception in 1924."
REASONING,"This view finds support from a number of reported cases(1), and in all these cases the rent payable was a yearly rental."
REASONING,"On this finding no other question would arise and as the validity of the notice has not been questioned before us, the plaintiff would be enti tled to a decree in his favour."
RPC,The appeal thus fails and is dismissed with costs.
RPC,Appeal dismissed.

FACTS,"The question involved in the appeal relates to the right of succession to six Birbhum ghatwalis governed by Regulation XXIX of 1814, annexed to Gaddi Pathrol and lying within Tappasarath in the Santhal Parganas."
FACTS,the genealogy of the contestants appears from the following pedigree table: .
FACTS,"Digbijoy Singh I Gurohari SinghKanhai Singh Bhairo Singh Balram Singh (Ghatwal) I I Pratar Singh I I I I I Banwari Singh Pitambar Katku Singh Bharat Singh (Died (Ghatwal) issueless) I Kharagdhari Singh (Ghatwal) I Ram Chandra Singh (Ghatwal) I I Brijbehari Singh Sarju Prasad Singh (Ghatwal) (Original plaintiff) I I Krishna Prasad Singh Hargobind Prasad Singh (Ghatwal) (Substituted plaintiff) I I Kali Prasad Singh Durga Prasad (Ghatwal) ( Died issueless) I Phaldani Kumari (Defendant) Tikait Kali Prasad Singh, the last gaddidar of Pathrol, died in the year 1935."
FACTS,He belonged to the Baisi Chaurasi clan.
FACTS,"On the 29th November, 1935, the 155 Commissioner of Bhagalpur Division recognized Smt."
FACTS,"Phaldani Kumari as the next ghatwal and entitled to be maintained in possession of the ghatwali estate on the 30th November, 1936, sarju Prasad Singh brought the suit out of which this appeal arises in forma pauperis in the court of the Subor dinate Judge of Deoghar for possession of the ghatwalis."
FACTS,"In paragraphs 7, 8 and 10 of the plaint it was alleged that the ghatwalis in suit were joint family property and were im partible by custom; that succession to them was governed by the law of lineal primogeniture; that the females and persons claiming through them were altogether excluded from inheritance."
FACTS,It was claimed that the late Tikait Kali Prasad Singh and the plaintiff were members of a joint Mitakshara family and that he alone as the eldest member of the eldest surviving line of the descendants of the common ancestor was entitled to succeed to them.
FACTS,The defendant in her written statement denied this claim and contended that Birbhum ghatwalis governed by Regulation XXIX of 1814 are not and cannot be in the nature of joint family property but that the person who succeeds and holds the tenure as ghatwal is the sole proprietor and owner thereof.
FACTS,"It was pleaded that the properties being the exclusive and separate properties of the ghatwal for the time being, the defendant, his widow, was entitled to suc ceed to them in preference to the plaintiff under the Mitak shara school of Hindu law which admittedly governed the family of the parties."
FACTS,The pleadings of the parties gave rise to the following issues : 1.
FACTS,Whether succession to the ghatwalis in question is governed by the customs alleged in para 7 of the plaint ? 2.
FACTS,"Did the ghatwalis in question form joint family property of Kali Prasad Singh, his ancestors in the direct line and of Sarju Prasad Singh and the plaintiff? 3."
FACTS,Did Kali Prasad die in a state of jointness with Sarju Prasad Singh ? 156 4.
FACTS,Are the ghatwals the sole proprietors of the ghatwalis for the time being as alleged by the defendant ? 5.
FACTS,"Whether the plaintiff or the defendant is entitled to succeed to the properties in suit ? Issues 2, 3 and 4 were found by the trial Judge in favour of the plaintiff and against the defendant."
FACTS,It was held that Kali Prasad Singh died in a state of jointness with Sarju Prasad Singh and that the ghatwalis in question were their joint family property and that the plaintiff the eldest surviving copartner in the eldest line of Digbijoy Singh 's descendants was entitled to succeed to them in preference to the widow.
FACTS,"It was common ground between the parties that in case the properties were held to be the separate properties of Kali Prasad Singh, the widow was entitled to succeed to them."
FACTS,As a result of these findings the plaintiff 's suit was decreed with costs.
FACTS,"On appeal by the widow to the High Court, this."
FACTS,decree was reversed and the plaintiff 's suit was dismissed with costs.
FACTS,"It was held that the character of the ghatwali tenures in question was such that they could not be regarded as joint property of the plaintiff and the last ghatwal and that being so, the defendant was entitled to succeed to them."
ARG,The learned counsel for the appellant based his argu ments on the thesis that the ghatwali estates in question were of the same nature and character as joint family im partible estates governed by the Mitakshara law and that the rule of survive applicable to such estates was also applicable to them.
ARG,It was contended that the High Court was in error in holding that the suit properties exclusively belonged to Kali Prasad Singh or that there was anything peculiar in these tenures which differentiated them from other ghatwalis in the Santhai Pargangs or from other im partible estates known to Hindu law and which peculiarity incapacitated them from being included within the definition of coparcenary property.
ARG,The plea that females were by custom excluded from inheriting ghatwali tenures in Birbhum was 157 dropped in the two courts below and was ' not raised before us; so also the point of custom set out in para.
ARG,7 of the plaint and covered by issue 1 was not seriously urged.
ARG,"The learned Attorney General, while conceding that succession to these tenures was governed by the Mitakshara law, contended that in no sense could they be regarded as joint family property and that their peculiar characteris tics precluded the acquisition of any right by birth by members of a joint Hindu family in them."
ARG,"He also urged in the alternative that the widow was 'entitled to succeed to them, assuming them to be joint family property under cus tom."
REASONING,The courts below have given elaborate judgments in the case and reference has been made to a large number of decid ed cases.
REASONING,"In our opinion, the main point that needs decision is whether the suit ghatwalis were to be regarded as joint family or separate properties of the deceased."
REASONING,For a solu tion of this problem it is necessary to refer first to the nature and main incidents of a ghatwali tenure.
REASONING,Its origin is now well known.
REASONING,"In Moghul times grants of land were made to selected persons who were appointed guardians of the mountain passes for protecting the countryside against hill invaders and the office held by these persons bore the designation ""ghatwal""."
REASONING,These grants were made in some cases directly by the ruling power and in other cases by the zamindar responsible by custom for the maintenance of secu rity and order within the estate as consideration for the performance of the duties.
REASONING,"By efflux of time these grants assumed the form of an actual estate in land, heritable and perpetual, but conditional upon services certain or services to be demanded."
REASONING,Reference to some of the decided cases relating to Birbhum ghatwali tenures will sufficiently indicate their nature and character.
PRECEDENT,"In Harlal Singh vs Joravan Singh(1), it was held that a ghatwali estate in Birbhum was not divisible (1) 6 Select."
REASONING,"21 158 on the death of a ghatwal, amongst his heirs but should devolve entirely on the eldest son or the next ghatwal."
REASONING,"It was said that ghatwali lands are grants for particular pur poses, especially of police, and to divide them into small portions amongst the heirs of the ghatwals would defeat the very ends for which the grants were made."
PRECEDENT,"In Satrukchunder Dey vs Bhagat Bharutchunder Singh(1), a decision of the year 1853, it was stated that the ghatwali tenures in Birbhum were not private property of the ghatwals but lands assigned by the State in remuneration for specific police services and were not alienable or attachable for personal debts."
PRECEDENT,"Kustooree Koomaree vs Monohur Deo(2), Loch J. took the view that succession to ghatwalis is regulated by no rule of kulachar or family custom, nor by the Mitakshara law, but solely by the nature of the ghatwali tenure, which descends undivided to the party who succeeds to and holds the tenure as ghatwal and that a female is not incapable of holding a ghatwali tenure."
PRECEDENT,"It was said that ""the party who succeeds to and holds the tenure as ghatwal must be, and has always been, looked upon as sole proprietor thereof, and, therefore, the other members of the family cannot claim to be coparceners and entitled to share in the profits of the property, though they may, by the permission and goodwill of the incumbent, derive their support, either from some portion of the property which he may have assigned to them, or directly from himself."" In Binode Ram Sein vs Deputy Commissioner of Santhai Pargangs(3), (on review it was held that the rents of a ghatwali tenure are not liable for the debts of the former deceased holder of the tenure."
PRECEDENT,The reason for the decision was that the tenure was held for the purpose of public services and those who perform the services are entitled to the whole of the remuneration.
PRECEDENT,"159 In Tekait Durga Pershad Singh vs Teketnee Durga Kuari(1), it was urged that a female 's right to inherit was inconsistent with a ghatwali estate."
PRECEDENT,This contention was negatived and reference was made to the fact that many ghatwali estates were held by females and it was observed that it was difficult to hold that a ghatwali estate must necessarily be held by male heirs.
PRECEDENT,"This case further sug gests that in a case where it is held proved that the family was joint, succession to Birbhum ghatwali may be regulated by the same rule of Hindu law as is applicable to the devo lution of impartible estates."
PRECEDENT,"In Ram Narain Singh vs Ramoon Paurey(2), another Birbhum ghatwali case, it was held that the ghatwal for the time being was only entitled to interest on the compensation money obtained for compulsory acquisition of a part of the ghatwali interest but that he could not spend the corpus of it which had to devolve on the next heir intact."
PRECEDENT,"So far as Birbhum ghatwalis are concerned, it is only the above mentioned cases to which our attention was drawn."
REASONING,Reference in this connection is also necessary to the terms of Regulation XXIX of 1814.
REASONING,Sections I and II of the Regulation which are material to this enquiry are in these terms : I.
REASONING,"Whereas the lands held by the class of persons denom inated Ghautwauls, in the district of Beerbhoom, form a peculiar tenure to which the provisions of the existing Regulations are not expressly applicable; and whereas every ground exists to believe that, according to the former usages and constitution of the country, this class of per sons are entitled to hold their lands, generation after generation, in perpetuity, subject nevertheless to the payment of a fixed and established rent to the zemindar of Beerbhoom, and to the performance of certain duties for the maintenance of the public peace and support of the police; and whereas the rents payable by those tenants have been (1) (2) 160 recently adjusted, after a full and minute inquiry made by the proper officers in the revenue department; and whereas it is essential to give stability to the arrangements now established among the Ghautwauls, the following rules have been adopted, to be in force from the period of their pro mulgation in the district of Beerbhoom."
REASONING,"A settlement having lately been made on the part of the Government with the Ghautwauls in the district of Beerb hoom, it is hereby declared that they and their descendants in perpetuity shall be maintained in possession of the lands, so long as they shall respectively pay the revenue at present assessed upon them,. "" The result of the decided cases and of the provisions of the regulation is that the grantee of the tenure and his descendants have to be maintained in possession of the land from generation to generation conditional upon services to be rendered."
REASONING,The tenure is however liable to forfeiture for misconduct or misbehavior of the ghatwal for the time being.
REASONING,The succession to it is determined by the rule of lineal primogeniture.
REASONING,"It is neither partible nor alienable (except in exceptional cases with the consent of the government or the zamindar, as the case may be)."
REASONING,These two characteristics are inherent in its very nature and have not been annexed to it by any rule of custom.
REASONING,The estate in the hands of the last holder is not liable either to attachment or sale in execution of a decree against him; nor is it liable in the hands of his successor for payment of his debts.
REASONING,"When the succession opens out, the heir determined according to law has to execute a muchilika in favour of the grantor guaranteeing the performance of the duties annexed to the office and stipulating that in case of misconduct or misbehaviour or non fulfilment of the obligations attaching to the office, as to which the tenure is in the nature of a remuneration, government will have the right to resume it."
REASONING,"In view of these peculiar characteristics of a ghatwali tenure in Birbhum which are so different from other inheri tances, we find it difficult to apply to it the 161 law of Mitakshara to the full extent."
REASONING,The essence of a coparcenary under the Mitakshara law is unity of ownership.
PRECEDENT,"As observed in Katama Natchir vs The Raja of Sivaganga(1), there has to be community of interest and unity of posses sion between all the, members of the family, and upon the death of any one of them the others may well take by survi vorship that in which they had during the deceased 's life time a common interest and a common possession."
PRECEDENT,The inci dents attaching to a Birbhum ghatwali tenure rule out the existence of any notion of community of interest and unity of possession of the members of the family with the holder for the time being.
PRECEDENT,He is entitled to be maintained in exclusive possession of the ghatwali lands and the devolu tion of the property is to him in the status of a sole heir.
PRECEDENT,"This view finds support from the observations of Lord Fitz gerald in Kali Pershad vs Anand Roy(2), though made in respect of a zamindari ghatwali, yet also appositely ap plicable to a government ghatwali."
PRECEDENT,"His Lordship observed as follows : ""Where, however, the Mitakshara governs, each son imme diately on his birth takes a share equal to his father in the ancestral immoveable estate."
PRECEDENT,"Having regard to the origin and nature of ghatwali tenures and their purposes and inci dents as established by decided cases, most of which have been referred to in the course of the argument, it is admit ted that such a tenure is in some particulars distinct from, and cannot be governed by, either the general objects of Hindu inheritance as above stated, or by the before quoted rule of the Mitakshara."
PRECEDENT,"It is admitted that a ghatwali estate is impartable that is to say, not subject to partition; that the eldest son succeeds to the whole to the exclusion of his brothers."
PRECEDENT,These are propositions that seem to exclude the application of the Mitakshara rule that the sons on birth each take an equal estate with the father and are entitled to partition.
PRECEDENT,""" Similar opinion was expressed in Chhalraclhari Singh vs Saraswati Kumari(3), by a Bench of the (1) (1861 3) 9 M.I.A. 543."
REASONING,"The following passage from that a decision may be quoted with advantage : ""The learned pleader for the appellant has however con tended before us ,that, although this ghatwali tenure is impartible, yet according to the decision of their Lordships of the Privy Council in Chintaman Singh vs Nowlukho Koon wari(1), it is not necessarily separate property, and that as their Lordships observe 'whether the general status of a Hindu family be joint or undivided, property which is joint will follow one and property which is separate will follow another course of succession. ' The decision referred to is no doubt an authority for the proposition that there may be impartible joint family property, such as a raj or other estate similar to a raj, but whether such property is to be regarded as joint or separate would appear to depend generally upon the character of the property at its incep tion, such as the nature of the grant, etc."
REASONING,creating it.
REASONING,"Having regard however to the view we have already expressed as to the status of the family in the present case, and as to the ghatwali tenure having been the exclusive property of Ananta Narain, we think it is unnecessary to determine what was originally the character of this tenure, although, if we were called upon to decide the question, we should be disposed to say, with reference to the peculiar character of these tenures as described in Regulation XXIX of 1814, that they were intended to be the exclusive property of the ghatwalforthe time being, and not joint family property in the proper sense of the In Raja Durga Prashad Singh vs Tribeni Singh(2), again it was said as follows : ""It was certainly an advantage to the whole family that one of their members should hold the office and the tenure."
REASONING,"He could put other members of the family into minor offices and grant them subordinate interests commonly called jotes, and he could and would generally provide for the family in the manner (1) (2) (1918) 45 I.A. 251. 163 expected of its head."
REASONING,But this is a long way off making him a trustee for the family or treating the ghatwali estate as possessed by the family and reducing the ghatwali to the position of karta or managing head of the family.
REASONING,"Their Lordships do not find that the incidents of ghatwali tenure are such as to give the family any rights over the property while it is in the hands of the ghatwal, and they find themselves upon this point in full agreement with the courts in India."
REASONING,""" In Narayan Singh vs Niranjan Chakravarti(1), Lord Sumner made an exhaustive review of the decided cases and examined the whole position of ghatwali tenures generally and ob served that where the tenure is hereditary, a recognized right to be appointed ghatwal takes the place of a formal appointment and a recognized right in the superior to dis miss the ghatwal if he is no longer able and willing to render the service required by his tenure, and to appoint another to the office and the tenure of the lands, then readily suffices to maintain in perpetuity the incidents of the tenure."
REASONING,"In these circumstances it is not possible to hold that the Mitakshara rule that when a person inherits property from any one of his three immediate paternal ancestors, his sons, grandsons and great grandsons acquire an interest in it by birth can have any application to the case of these grants which are in the nature of a remuneration for the performance of certain services by the holder of that of fice."
REASONING,"A ghatwali has to be regarded as something connected with an office and as observed by Lord Sumner in the above mentioned case, the office cannot except by special custom, grant or other arrangement, either run with lands or be served from them."
REASONING,"In other words, just as primogeniture and impartibility are handmaids, similarly the ghatwal 's office and the ghatwali tenure are two inseparables and cannot be lodged in separate compartments."
REASONING,"If the office cannot be in the nature of coparcenary property, the tenure must follow the same way."
REASONING,Thus it is not easy to conceive that an inter est (1) (1924) 51 I.A. 37.
REASONING,"164 can be acquired at the birth of a member of a joint family in a tenure which is annexed to an office, even if it has descended from three immediate paternal ancestors."
REASONING,In certain eventualities the selection of the next heir depends on the choice of the ruling authority and in case of miscon duct or misbehaviour of the holder for the time being the ruling power can not only dismiss the ghatwal but even resume the tenure.
REASONING,This is a feature which places this heritable property in a class by itself as distinguished from other inheritances governed by the Mitakshara law.
REASONING,"The view that in Birbhum, ghatwali tenures are in the nature of separate property or the exclusive property of the ghatwal finds support from the fact that in many instances, whenever succession has opened out in respect of them, it has been determined according to the Mitakshara rule ap plicable to the devolution of separate property irrespective of the circumstance whether the deceased died in joint or separate status with the other members of the family."
REASONING,"Thirteen instances of such practice in the past amongst members of the Bais Chaurasi clan were proved in the case, in all of which the widow succeeded in preference to a male heir."
REASONING,"The learned trial Judge held that in some of these instances the female succeeded because the agnate nearest in line was separate from her husband; as regards the others though he reached the conclusion that the evidence of sepa ration was weak, he thought that these did not establish a custom superseding in cases of joint family property the rule of survivorship."
REASONING,The High Court was of a different opinion.
REASONING,"It rightly remarked that while numerous instances of female succession to the estates held by Baisi Chaurasi gaddidar 's had been proved, not a single instance of a female having been excluded from the appointment of a ghat wal on the ground of an agnate being entitled to come in as a coparcener of the last holder by survivorship had been proved, and that in these circumstances there was force in the contention that even if the tenures in question were ancestral joint family property, succession thereto was 165 governed by the Mitakshara rule applicable to separate property."
REASONING,"For the reasons given above we held that the Mitakshara rule that the property inherited by a person from his imme diate paternal ancestors becomes ancestral in his hands and in it his sons, grandsons and great grandsons acquire a right at the moment of the birth has no apposite application to Birbhum ghatwali tenures."
REASONING,"The learned counsel for the appellant in support of his contention placed reliance on a number of decisions of their Lordships of the Privy Council concerning impartible estates governed by the Mitakshara law, wherein it was held that the succession to an impartible estate which is the ancestral property of a joint Hindu family governed by the Mitakshara law is governed by the rule of survivorship subject to the custom of impartibility; the eldest member of the senior branch of the family succeeding in preference to the direct lineal senior descendants of the common ancestor, if the latter is more remote in degree."
PRECEDENT,"Particular reference was made to the remarks of Turner L. I. in the Sivaganga case(1), and to the observations in Baijnath Prasad Singh vs Tej Bali Singh (2) and in the case of Shiba Prasad Singh vs Rani Prayag Kumari Debi(3)."
REASONING,"Therein it was said that in the case of ordinary joint family property the members Of the family have (1) the right of partition, (2) the right to restrain alienations by the head, (3) the right of mainte nance, and (4) the right of survivorship."
REASONING,"The first of these rights cannot exist in the case of an impartible estate, though ancestral, from the very nature of the estate."
REASONING,The second and third are incompatible with the custom of impart ibility.
REASONING,"To this extent the general law of the Mitakshara has been superseded by custom and the impartible estate, though ancestral, is clothed with the incidents of self acquired and separate property."
REASONING,But the right of survivor ship is not inconsistent with the custom of impartibility.
REASONING,"22 166 therefore still remains and to this extent the estate still retain.s its character of joint family property and its devolution is governed by the general Mitakshara law applicable to such property and that though the other rights which a coparcener acquires by birth in joint family proper ty no longer exist, the birthright of the senior member to take by survivorship still remains."
REASONING,"In our view, these observations have no application to the tenures in suit."
REASONING,"As already indicated, it is not possi ble to concede in their case that a member of a joint family governed by the Mitakshara law acquires any right by birth in them."
REASONING,The general law of Mitakshara creating that right seems to have been superseded in their case not only by peculiarities inherent in the nature of these tenures but by encroachments of custom on it.
REASONING,"Moreover, it appears that the remarks relied upon were made in cases where the impartible estates were admittedly joint family property or the grants were of such a character that they are intended for the benefit of the family as such."
REASONING,"The ratio of these decisions was that even though certain incidents attaching to joint family property may cease to exist by custom, some others which are not affected by custom may survive."
REASONING,This reasoning can have no application to property which at no stage what ever could be clothed or was clothed with any of the inci dents of coparcenary property.
REASONING,The learned counsel for the appellant placed considera ble reliance on the observations of Sir Dawson Miller C.J. in Fulbati Kumari vs Maheshwari Prasad(1).
REASONING,The learned Chief Justice therein dissented from the View urged before him that all ghatwali property is the exclusive separate property of the holder for the time being and that it de volves according to the rules affecting separate property subject again to the circumstance of impartibility.
REASONING,"He observed that the fact that a raj is impartible does not in a case governed by the Mitakshara law make it separate or self acquired property, that it may be self acquired (1) A. I. R. 1923 Pat."
REASONING,167 property or it may be the property of a joint undivided family and that in the latter case succession will be regu lated according to the rule of survivorship.
REASONING,"In our opinion, these observations have no application to the case of Birb hum ghatwalis because in express terms these were excluded from consideration in that case."
REASONING,"In the judgment it was said : ""In our opinion, the estate in the present case is in no way comparable to the Birbhum ghatwali tenures and Regula tion XXIX of 1814 does not apply to it."" The decision in the case proceeded on the assumption that Birbhum ghatwalis stood apart from other ghatwalis which stood on the same footing as impartible estates gov erned by Mitakshara law."
REASONING,The learned Attorney General challenged the correctness of these decisions and contended that the decisions of the Privy Council on this subject were not uniform.
PRECEDENT,"He drew our attention to the observations made in Sartaj Kuari 's case(1), in the Second Pittapur case(2), and in Tipperah case(3)."
PRECEDENT,"There may be a seeming conflict between the view expressed in those decisions and the view expressed in Baijnath Prasad Singh vs Tej Bali Singh(4), and in Shiba Prasad Singh vs Rani Prayag Kurnari Debi(5)."
REASONING,It seems to us however that these latter cases have settled the law ap plicable to joint family impartible estates governed by Mitakshara law and it is rather late in the day to reopen a controversy settled by a series of decisions of the Privy Council.
REASONING,The contention that on the death of the last holder a ghatwali tenure in Birbhum reverts to the grantor and that notionally there is a resumption of it in favour of govern ment and a re grant to the next heir does not impress us.
REASONING,On the express terms of the regulation these tenures are heritable from generation to generation and the theory of resumption and re grant is inconsistent with their heritable character.
REASONING,Inheritance can never remain in abeyance and on the (1) (4) All.
REASONING,168 death of the last holder the estate immediately vests in the next heir.
REASONING,The circumstance that the government may in certain events have the power to dismiss a ghatwal or to forfeit the tenure cannot lead to the inference that it terminates and is re granted at every death.
REASONING,"The argument of the learned counsel for the appellant that a widow not being a descendant of the grantee under the terms of Regulation XXIX of 1814, is not entitled to inherit to Birbhum ghatwali tenures also does not impress us."
REASONING,"The regulation does not enact any rule of succession to these tenures, and the devolution with respect to them is admit tedly determined by personal law or custom."
REASONING,"The expression ""descendants"" used in the regulation cannot deprive females, like a widow or a mother, from taking the inheritance where they are legal heirs under Mitakshara law or under custom."
REASONING,Females have invariably been allowed to succeed to these tenures in the past.
REASONING,"The appellant 's counsel conceded that if the property was the separate property of Kali Prasad Singh, the defendant was entitled to inherit to it."
REASONING,"We think that the expression ""descendants"" has been loosely employed in the regulation for the word ""heirs""."
PRECEDENT,On this point we are in agreement with the observations made by a Bench of the Calcutta High Court in Chhatradhari Singh vs Saraswyati Kumari(1).
REASONING,"It may further be pointed out that even if the conten tion of the learned counsel for the appellant is to be accepted, by no process could the trial court have passed a decree in favour of the plaintiff in respect of items 4, 5 and 6 of the schedule Admittedly these were acquired by Krishna Prasad Singh, father of Kali Prasad Singh by a decree of court passed in his favour against his collateral Katku Singh who also claimed these properties as an heir to the last male owner Banwari Singh (vide Exhibit 4)."
REASONING,"These pro perties having devolved upon Krishna Prasad Singh by obstructed heritage, were in the nature of separate property in his hands and could not fall within the (1) Cal."
REASONING,"Sarju Prasad Singh, uncle of Krishna Prasad Singh, could acquire no right or roterest in these properties by birth enabling him to claim them by survivorship."
REASONING,Kali Prasad Singh who inherited them on the death of his father got them as his separate property as he had no son who could acquire any interest in them by birth.
REASONING,With regard to this property the widow was certainly an heir after the death of her husband ' and plaintiff could have no claim whatsoever in respect of these items of the schedule.
REASONING,This aspect of the case seems to have been lost sight of in the two courts below.
REASONING,"The result, therefore, is that this appeal fails and is dismissed with costs."
REASONING,"While agreeing generally with my learned brother Mahajan J., I wish to say a few words to indicate the main ground on which I would dismiss this appeal."
REASONING,"There are a number of authoritative decisions dealing with the special features of ghatwali property, one of which is said to be that if the ghatwal is a member of a joint family, the family has no right over the property while it is in his hands."
REASONING,[See Durga Prashad Singh vs Tribeni Singh(1)].
REASONING,The logical corollary from this characteristic of ghatwali property would seem to be that it is more in the nature of exclusive property of the ghatwal than of joint family property.
REASONING,"Nevertheless, in some cases, succession to such property has been determined with reference to the rules of Hindu law regarding joint property, where the ghatwal was found to be a member of the joint family."
REASONING,"As at present advised I am not prepared to say that those cases were wrongly decided, but I think it will not be incorrect to say that custom and usage are also important factors governing succession to ghatwali property, and it is con ceivable that while in some cases custom may develop on the lines of Hindu law relating to succession owing to repeated instances of (1) (1918) 45 I.A. 251. 170 tacit and unquestioned application of the law, in other i.a cases succession to ghatwali property may be governed not entirely by Hindu law but by such law as modified in certain respects by usage and custom."
REASONING,"The question with which we are concerned in this case is whether the widow of a deceased ghatwal, who was a member of a joint family and died leaving no issue or direct male descendants, can succeed to the ghatWali property in prefer ence to the nearest male agnate."
REASONING,"On a reference to the plaint, it would appear that what the plaintiff contended was that the clan to which the parties belong was governed by the Mitakshara school of Hindu law ""subject to their clan custom"", one of which was said to be that females, viz., widow, daughter or mother, and persons claiming through females could not and did not succeed on the death of the ghatwal."
REASONING,"This allegation was controverted in the written statement, and it was claimed that the family was governed by the Mitakshara system of law and ""there was no clan custom governing the estate in suit."
REASONING,""" Upon these pleadings, one of the issues framed by the trial court was ""whether succession to the ghatwali is governed by custom, as alleged in paragraph 7 of the plaint."" In the course of the trial, the plaintiff tried to prove that females were always excluded as alleged by him."
REASONING,"In this, he did not succeed."
REASONING,"The courts below however found that the question which directly affected the present case was a much narrower one, namely, whether females could succeed even when the family was joint."
REASONING,"So far as this question is con cerned, both the courts below are agreed that females cannot be excluded if the property is the separate property of the ghatwal."
REASONING,But the question which still remains to be decided is what the true legal position would be if the property is deemed to be joint property.
REASONING,"It appears that evidence was adduced at the trial to show that in 13 instances affecting the Baisi Chaurasi clan to whom the Birbhum ghatwals admit tedly belong, the widow of the last ghatwal succeeded in preference to a male agnate."
REASONING,"171 The trial judge however found that in four of these in stances the nearest agnate who claimed the property was separate from the ghatwal or his widow, but, in the other instances, there was no evidence of separation, or ""the evidence was weak"", which, I take it, is another way of saying that it could not be safely relied on."
REASONING,"It seems to me that these instances lend some support to the view that Hindu law has been modified ' by custom, so far as the Birb hum ghatwalis are concerned, and that among the ghatwals belonging to this class, where the last ghatwal dies leaving a widow but no issue, then she succeeds in preference to the nearest male agnate, even though the family may be joint."
REASONING,"The Birbhum ghatwals form a class by themselves, and they are also subject to a special Regulation Regulation XXIX of 1814."
REASONING,That Regulation states among other things that this class of ghatwals shall be entitled to hold the ghatwali property generation after generation and that they and their descendants in perpetuity shall be maintained in possession of such property.
REASONING,"Strictly speaking, neither a widow nor a distant agnate will come within the terms of the Regulation, not being a descendant of the last ghatwal, and therefore custom and usage cannot be ruled out in determining succes sion in such cases."
REASONING,"The strongest case which was relied upon by the appellant is Fulbati Kumari vs Maheshwari Pra sad(1) where it was laid down that on the death of a ghat wal, who was a member of a joint family, the ghatwali property would devolve according to the rules of Hindu law affecting joint property, that iS to say, by the rule of survivorship."
REASONING,"But, in this case, Dawson Miller C.J. who delivered the judgment, took care to observe that the ghat wali estate which was the subject of litigation was not comparable to the Birbhum ghatwali 'tenures, which means that the rule laid down in that case may not apply to Birb hum ghatwals."
REASONING,"In the present case, the Commissioner, who represented the Government and who had special means of knowing the usages affecting the Birbhurn ghatwals."
REASONING,(1) A.I.R. 1923 Pat.
REASONING,"453. 172 appointed the respondent as the ghatwal, stating that he was ""following a well established precedent in the case of these ghatwals by recognizing the widow in the absence of a direct heir."
REASONING,""" In my opinion, whatever evidence there is in this case supports the Commissioner 's view, and there is hardly any cogent evidence to rebut it."
RPC,"In the circumstances, I agree that this appeal ought to be dis missed with costs."
RPC,Appeal dismissed.

JUDGE,the Judgment of the Court was delivered by KANIA C.J.
FACTS,"These are five companion appeals from the judgment of the High Court at Orissa, delivered on five petitions filed by the respondent in each of the appeals, to obtain from the Court a writ of mandamus and/or directions under article 226 of 'the Constitution of India."
FACTS,Each of the respondents alleged that between 1941 and 1947 he had agreed to take from the Ruler of Keonjhar a mining lease and had entered into possession of the area.
FACTS,Some of the petitioners alleged that they had spent money on the development of the mines and installed machinery to work the same.
FACTS,It is however common ground that there was no registered lease in favour of any of the respondents before 1947.
FACTS,"On the 14th December, 1947, the Ruler of Keonjhar entered into a merger agreement with the Dominion of India and as from the 1st January, 1948, the State was merged in the Dominion of India."
FACTS,"After signing the merger agreement the Ruler gave registered 30 leases on the 27th December, 1947, to the respondents in these appeals."
FACTS,"In pursuance of the exercise of the powers conferred on the Government of Orissa by section 4 of the Extra Provincial Jurisdiction Act, 1949, read with Notifica tion No. 172/1B dated 23rd March, 1948, of the Government of India, the Government of Orissa issued a notification dated the 8th of June, 1949, declaring, inter alia, the said leases to be void and not binding on it."
FACTS,This annulment was made expressly on the ground that these commitments were not reasonable and bona fide.
FACTS,"Thereafter, the respondents, along with others approached the Orissa Government to give them leases and the State Government gave them temporary permits to work the mines in November, 1949."
FACTS,"On the 3rd July, 1951, however they passed an order cancelling the temporary per mits and directed the respondents to remove their assets appertaining to the respective mines within a fortnight."
FACTS,"The respondents thereupon filed the petitions before the Orissa High Court praying for writs or directions in the nature of mandamus against the State of Orissa directing them to withdraw the notices dated the 8th of June and 3rd of July, 1951, and to forbear from acting upon or giving effect to the same."
FACTS,"The Court, after noticing the rival contentions of the parties and rejecting the contention that the State of Orissa had cancelled the permits and were attempting to take possession as an act of State, posed the question ""whether the law of annulment relied upon by the State was applicable to the mining leases granted to the petitioners, or in the alternative, whether the State had any right in law to cancel the leases before the period mentioned therein."
FACTS,""" Referring to the contention of the State rounded on the acceptance by the respondents of the temporary permits and the estoppel arising therefrom, Ray C.J. in his judgment stated as follows : ""In determining the validity of this contention (relating to the temporary permit and estoppel arising therefrom) the circumstances under which these applications were made and the legal implications of such applications and the permissions granted under 31 them will have to be considered."
FACTS,It is remote from our intention to express any opinion in this summary proceeding as to the respective merits of the rival contentions.
FACTS,I am however satisfied that in the context of events and in the logic of circumstances attending thereto there is a case to be tried.
FACTS,""" He next considered the scope of the writ of mandamus and came to the conclusion that ""at the moment"" the respondents had no alternative legal remedy, equally conven ient, beneficial and effectual because the respondents could not file a suit till after the expiry of the period of sixty days required for the purpose under section 80 of the Civil Procedure Code and he thought that unless protected by the Court in the meanwhile the respondents would undergo irrepa rable and irremediable loss of possession of the mining leases involving a huge waste of labour, machinery and other resources of equipments of immense value hardly capable of being remedied by payments of money as compensation."
FACTS,"The Bench therefore passed an order dated 2nd August, 1951, as follows : ""We direct that till three months from today or one week after the institution of their (respondents ') contemplated suit, whichever is earlier, the Government of the State of Orissa should refrain from disturbing the petitioners ' possession over the mining areas in question and that thereafter this order will cease to have effect."
FACTS,""" They gave further directions as to how the mines were to be worked during the aforesaid period."
FACTS,"Towards the end of the judgment it was stated, ""In the result, the petitions are allowed in part to the limited extent indicated above."" Narasimham J. agreed with the order set out in the judgment of the Chief Justice although his judgment shows the concur rence to be very halting."
FACTS,"He stated that although he was reluctant to exercise the powers under article 226 because the present respondents could file a suit, yet as in view of section 80 of the Civil Procedure Code there would be an unavoidable delay resulting in irreparable loss to the respondents he agreed that the order should be passed as mentioned in the judgment of the Chief Justice, 32 Towards the end of his judgment he stated as follows: ""It should however be clearly emphasized that the observations contained in this judgment should not be taken as pre judg ing any question which may.arise for the consideration of the Civil Court in the event of the petitioners filing a regular suit and seeking interim relief from that Court by way of temporary injunction, appointment of receiver or otherwise."
FACTS,"If such an application is made, the questions as to whether the petitioners have a prima facie case for trial or whether such a suit is maintainable or whether the bal ance of convenience requires that they should be permitted to remain in possession of the leasehold property till the termination of the suit and other allied matters should all be dealt with by the Court concerned without being influ enced in any way by the observations contained in this judgment."
FACTS,Those observations have been made for the limited purpose of granting temporary relief under article 226 and are not intended to embarrass either party or the Court in future litigation.
FACTS,""" It appears that thereafter an application was made to stay the operation of this order to enable the Government of Orissa to appeal against the order of the 2nd of August."
FACTS,"The same Judges on the 6th of August stayed the operation of the order for fifteen days and observed as follows : ""The effect of the order (of 2nd August, 1951) is that except giving them (respondents in these appeals) some interim measure of relief for the period during which the petition ers were without remedy, we were not inclined to accept the petition and issue a writ in the nature of mandamus, as prayed for."
FACTS,""" The State of Orissa has come on appeal to us and after hearing the arguments on both sides we came to the conclusion that the order of the High Court could not be sustained."
FACTS,"We accordingly passed the following order on the 15th of October: ""These five appeals are allowed and the order of the High Court is set aside in each case."
RLC,As the High Court has passed no other orders on the petitions.
RLC,"and indeed has stated that the Court was not prepared to 33 pass any ,other orders on the petitions, the petitions stand dismissed."
RLC,The respondents will pay the costs of the ap peals.
REASONING,""" Our reasons are these: Article ,226 of the Constitution of India runs as fol lows: 226."
REASONING,"(1)""Notwithstanding anything in article 32, every High Court shall have power, throughout the territories in relation to which it exercises jurisdiction, to issue to any person or authority, including in appropriate cases any Government, within those territories directions, orders or writs, including writs in the nature of habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto and certiorari, or any of them, for the enforcement of any of the rights conferred by Part III and for any other purpose."
REASONING,(2) The power conferred on a High Court by clause (1) shall not be in derogation of the power conferred on the Supreme Court by clause (2) of article The language of the Article shows that the issuing of writs or directions by the Court is not rounded only on its decision that a right of the aggrieved party under Part II1 of the Constitution (Fundamental Rights) has been in fringed.
REASONING,It can also issue writs or give similar directions for any other purpose.
REASONING,The concluding words of article 226 have to be read in the context of what precedes the same.
REASONING,Therefore the existence of the right is the foundation of the exercise of jurisdiction of the Court under this Arti cle.
REASONING,"The judgment of the Orissa High Court under appeal, however, shows that the Judges have decided nothing at all in respect of the rights of the parties."
REASONING,Indeed they have expressly stated that their observations should not in any way be considered as deciding any of the rights or conten tions of the parties raised in the petitions.
REASONING,"The whole judgment shows that because of the requirement of section 80 of the Civil Procedure Code the present respondents could not file a suit against the Government for at least sixty days, the 5 34 respondent 's position should not in the interval be dis turbed and accordingly the Court gave the directions in its order of the 2nd of August, 1951."
REASONING,"If there was any doubt about the nature of the relief desired to be granted by the order of 2nd August the same Judges have made it per fectly clear by their order of the 6th of August, wherein they have stated that except for these directions they were not prepared to make any other order on the petitions."
REASONING,"The result therefore is that while the Judges declined to inves tigate and pronounce on the rights of the parties and ex pressly kept the determination thereof in abeyance in the suit proposed to be filed by the present respondents, they gave directions for interim relief till such suit was filed."
REASONING,"It must be noted that with the passing of the order of the 2nd August, 1951, containing directions in the nature of interim relief the petitions were completely disposed of and have not been kept pending for disposal."
REASONING,Those directions embody therefore the final order passed by the Court on these petitions.
REASONING,A preliminary objection was raised about the maintainability of the appeals on the ground that no final orders were passed on the petitions.
REASONING,That objection must fail in view of the fact that with these orders the petitions were disposed of finally and nothing further remained to be done in respect of the petitions.
REASONING,The fact that the operation of the order is limited to three months or a week after the filing of the intended suit does not prevent the order from being final.
REASONING,On behalf of the appellant it was urged that the Court had no jurisdiction to pass such orders under article 226 under the circumstances of the case.
REASONING,This is not a case where the Court before finally disposing of a petition under article 226 gave directions in the nature of interim relief for the purpose of maintaining the status quo.
REASONING,", The question which we have to determine is whether directions in the nature of interim relief only could be granted under article 226, when the Court expressly stated that it refrained from determining the rights of the parties on which a writ 35 of mandamus or directions of a like nature could be issued."
REASONING,"In our opinion, article 226 cannot be used for the purpose of giving interim relief as the only and final relief on the application as the High Court has purported to do."
REASONING,"The directions have been given here only to circumvent the provisions of section 80 of the Civil Procedure Code, and in our opinion that is not within the scope of article 226."
REASONING,An interim relief can be granted only in aid of and as ancil lary to the main relief which may be available to the party on final determination of his rights in a suit or proceed ing.
REASONING,"If the Court was of opinion that there ' was no other convenient or adequate remedy open to the petitioners, it might have proceeded to investigate the case on its merits and come to a decision as to whether the petitioners suc ceeded in establishing that there was an infringement of any of their legal rights which entitled them to a writ of mandamus or any other directions of a like nature; and pending such determination it might have made a suitable interim order for maintaining the status quo ante."
REASONING,"But when the Court declined to decide on the rights of the parties and expressly held that they should be investigated more properly in a civil suit, it could not, for the purpose of facilitating the institution of such suit, issue directions in the nature of temporary injunctions, under article 226 of the Constitution."
RPC,"In our opinion, the language of article 226 does not permit such an action."
RPC,On that short ground the judgment of the Orissa High Court under appeal cannot be upheld.
RPC,Appeals allowed.

JUDGE,The Judgment of the Court was deliv ered by MUKHERJEA J.
FACTS,"This appeal is directed against a judgment and decree of a Division Bench of the Bombay High Court dated the 14th of March, 1945, which affirmed, on appeal, the decision of the First Class Subordinate Judge, Satara, passed in Civil Suit No 890 of 1938."
FACTS,"The appellants before us filed the suit as plaintiffs in the original court, for establishment of their title to the property in dispute which is known as Chikurde Estate, on the allegation that they were, under the Hindu Law, the nearest heirs of one Bhimabai, who was admittedly the last holder of the estate."
FACTS,"The suit was brought initially against one defendant, name ly, the Court of Wards, Satara, and admittedly the Court of Wards took possession of the property of Bhimabai, while she was alive, and is continuing in possession of the same even now after her death."
FACTS,"Later on, defendants 2, 3 and 4, who put forward rival claims of succession to the estate, were allowed to intervene in the suit and were added as parties defendants."
FACTS,"The Court of Wards, which now figures as defend ant No. 1, took up, all through, a neutral attitude and expressed its willingness to hand over the estate to any person who would be declared to be rightfully entitled to it by the Court."
FACTS,The Courts below have negatived the claims of defendants 2 and 3 and they have not come up to press.
FACTS,their claims in the appeal before us.
FACTS,"The two rival claim ants, who are now on the scene, are the plaintiffs on one side and defendant No. 4 on the other, and the whole contro versy in this appeal centres round the 210 point as to who amongst them have the preferential right to succeed to the disputed estate after the death of Bhimabai."
FACTS,"To appreciate the material facts of the case and the conten tions that have been raised by the parties, it will be convenient to refer to the following genealogy which is not disputed by either side."
FACTS,Vithalrao (died 1896) Ganpatrao (died 1914) Nilkanthrao Anandrao Tangawa alias (died 1899) (died 1913) Anandibai (Deft. 2) Krishnabai Adopted Deft.
FACTS,3 Vithalrao (Deft. 4) Babasaheb on adopted by 3 2 1939.
FACTS,Krishnabai on 4 11 1924 Respdt.
FACTS,Firangojirao (died Tanakka (predeceas angabai (died 15 11 1919.) ed her sister Gangabai on 14 2 1924) without any issue).
FACTS,Nathgauda Annagauda Balgauda (Plff. 2) Bhimabai (daughter) (Plff. No. 1) Appellant No. 2. (died on 27 1 1932).
FACTS,"Appellant No. 1 It is the case of both the parties that Vithalrao, whose name appears at the top of the pedigree table, and who was the common ancestor of the parties, held the disputed property as watan property appertaining to the hereditary office of Deshmukhi service."
FACTS,"Vithalrao was the recipient of a Sanad dated 28th November, 1892, under what was called the Gordon Settlement, the object of which was to commute serv ices of certain watandars in that part of the country and relieve them from liability to perform the services attached to their office on certain terms and conditions which were agreed upon between the Government on the one hand and the watandars on the other."
FACTS,The terms of the settlement were generally embodied in Sanads and one such Sanad was granted to Vithalrao in 1892.
FACTS,"It is not disputed that after this settlement Vithalrao continued to be watandar as defined by Bombay Act III of 1874, and that the watan in dispute was an impartible estate governed by the rule of 211 primogeniture."
FACTS,In 1896 Vithalrao died and he was succeeded by his eldest son Ganpatrao under the law of primogeniture.
FACTS,"Ganpatrao died childless in 1914, leaving behind him his two widows Anandibai and indirabai, of whom the senior widow Anandibais defendant No. 2 in the present suit."
FACTS,"Both the two brothers of Ganpatrao, namely, Nilkanthrao and Anan drao had predeceased him."
FACTS,"Nilkanthrao left behind him one son named Firangojirao and two daughters, while Anandrao died childless, leaving him surviving his widow Krishnabai, who later on adopted Vithalrao, who is defendant No. 4 in the suit."
FACTS,"Ganpatrao had left a will bequeathing all his watan and nonwatan properties to Firangojirao and the latter succeeded to the estate both under the will as well as under the law of lineal promogeniture, he being the only male member of the family at that time."
FACTS,"Firangojirao died in 1919, leaving Bhimabai, his only daughter, who was a minor at that time."
FACTS,"On 23rd September, 1921, the name of Bhimabai was entered in the village records as watandar in place of Firangojirao and in the year following the Court of Wards, Satara, assumed superintendence of Bhimabai 's estate."
FACTS,"On 11th October, 1923, the Government of Bombay by their Reso lution No. A 471 declared the Chikurde Deshmukh watan as lapsed to Government, presumably on the ground that there was no male heir in the watan family after the death of Firangojirao."
FACTS,"A new entry was then made in the village register which recorded Bhimabai not as watandar, but as heir of Firangojirao and the lands were described as being converted into ryotvari lands after forfeiture by Govern ment and subjected to full assessment."
FACTS,"On 4th of November, 1924, Krishnabai, the widow of Anandrao, adopted defendant No. 4 as a son to her husband."
FACTS,"On 27th January, 1932, Bhima bai died unmarried and her estate continued under the man agement of the Court of Wards."
FACTS,"The appellants before us, who are the sister 's sons of Firangojirao, brought this suit on 5th of August, 1938, and their case, in substance, is that after the Resolution of the Government passed on 11th 212 of October, 1923, the Chikurde estate ceased to be a watan property and the succession to such estate was governed by the ordinary rules of Hindu Law and not by the provisions of Act V of 1886 which postpone relations claiming through a female to a male member of the watan family."
FACTS,"It was urged that the property being the absolute property of Bhimabai and she having died while still a maiden, the plaintiffs, being the nearest heirs of her father, were entitled to succeed under the general rules of Hindu Law."
FACTS,"As said al ready, the defendant No. 4, who is respondent No. 2 in this appeal, was added as a party defendant sometime after the suit was filed and the contention raised on his behalf was that by reason of his having been duly adopted."
FACTS,"to Anandrao on 4th of November, 1924, he was the nearest heir to the property in suit which was a watan property and prayed that a declaration in his favour might be made by the court."
FACTS,"The defendant No. 3 claimed to have been adopted as a son to her husband Ganpatrao by Anandibai, the defendant No. 2, some time in February 1939."
RLC,The trial court on a consideration of the evidence came to the conclusion that the Chikurde estate was an impartible property governed by the rules of primogeniture.
RLC,"It was held that, it being an impartible joint estate, the rule of survivorship still applied and consequently on the death of Ganpatrao, without leaving any son, the estate passed by survivorship to the next senior branch which was that of Firangojirao."
RLC,The view taken by the Subordinate Judge is that after Firangojirao 's death Bhimabai took only a provi sional interest in the property which was liable to be divested by the emergence of a male member by adoption in the family and in fact she was legally divested of her interest in the property when defendant No. 4 was adopted by Anandrao 's widow.
RLC,"In the opinion of the Subordinate Judge the resolution of the Government treating the Chikurde estate as lapsed was premature and could not be made legally so long as there were widows living, who were capable of adopting sonS."
RLC,"The trial judge held further that even 213 if Bhimabai was taken to have held the property as watan till her death, the next heir to succeed under the Bombay Act V of 1886 would be defendant No. 4 and not the plain tiffs."
RLC,The result was that the plaintiffs ' suit was dismissed.
FACTS,The plaintiffs then took an appeal to the High Court of Bombay and this appeal was heard by a Division Bench consisting of Macklin in and Rajadhyaksha JJ.
RLC,"The learned Judges dismissed the appeal and confirmed the deci sion of the trial court, though the reasons given by them are not the same as those given by the trial judge."
RLC,"It was held by the High Court, on a construction of the Sanad granted to Vithalrao in 1892, that the order of lapse or forfeiture of the watan estate passed by the Government in the year 1923 on the ground of failure of male heirs was not a valid and legal order and although under the relevant clause of the Sanad the Government could, in the absence of male heirs, resume the watan in the sense that they could make the property liable to full assessment, the other incidents of the watan estate still continued."
REASONING,"Consequently, Act V of 1886 would still govern succession to such property and defendant No. 4 had preferential rights over the plain tiffs under section 2 of that Act."
REASONING,It is against this decision that the plaintiffs have come up on appeal to this court.
REASONING,The learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the plain tiffs appellants has raised a two fold contention in support of the appeal.
REASONING,"It has been contended in the first place that the High Court was in error in holding that the Chikurde estate retained its watan character even after it was re sumed by the Government by its Resolution of 11th October, 1923; and if it was non watan, the plaintiffs would be nearer heirs to Bhimabai than defendant No. 4."
REASONING,"The other contention raised is that even if the property remained watan in the hands of Bhimabai, the latter would have to be regarded as a watandar in the true sense of the word and would be a fresh stock of descent."
REASONING,"In that view the plain tiffs would come within the family of 28 214 watandar as defined in Bombay Act V of 1886, whereas the defendant No. 4 would be outside the family."
REASONING,"The points undoubtedly are interesting, but having regard to the view which we have decided to take, it would not be necessary to investigate the merits of either of them."
REASONING,It may be pointed out that the learned Judges of the High Court proceeded throughout on the assumption that the plaintiffs would have preferential rights of succession if the property was regarded as non watan in the hands of Bhimabai.
REASONING,"It is only if the property was watan that the Bombay Act of 1886 will apply and the plaintiffs, who were descended through females, would be postponed to defendant No. 4 who by adop tion became a male member of the family."
REASONING,"Mr. Setalvad, appearing for defendant No. 4 who is respondent No. 2 in this appeal, contended before us that this assumption is wrong, and that even if the property was regarded as nonwa tan property and belonging absolutely to Bhimabai as her stridhan, still as heir of Bhimabai 's absolute property the defendant No. 4 would have higher rights than the plain tiffs."
REASONING,"As this point was not touched upon in the judgments of either of the courts below, we heard the learned Counsel on both sides at great length upon it and the conclusion that we have reached is that the contention of the learned AttorneyGeneral is well founded and must prevail."
REASONING,"For the purpose of this argument we would assume that the property in suit was non watan stridhan property of Bhimabai and the only question is, as to who amongst the rival claimants would be the nearer heir after her death according to the Hindu Law of inheritance ? It is admitted that Bhimabai died while she was a maiden and that a maid en 's property under the Hindu Law goes in the first place to her uterine brothers, in default of them to the mother and then to the father."
REASONING,This is according to the text of Baudhayana (1)which is accepted by all the commenta tors.
REASONING,"Viramitrodaya adds to this that ""on failure of mother and father it goes to their (1) See Mitakshara, Chap."
REASONING,"II, sec."
REASONING,"XI, para 30."
REASONING,"215 nearest relations""(1)."
REASONING,"It has been held in a large number of cases that the expression ""nearest relations of the parents"" means and refers to the sapindas of then, father and in their default the sapindas of the mother both in order of propinquity(2)."
REASONING,"In the case c before us, both the plain tiffs and defendant No. 4 are sapindas of Firangojirao, the plaintiffs being the sister 's sons of Firangojirao, while the latter is his paternal uncle 's son."
REASONING,"It is not dis puted that apart from the changes introduced by the Hindu Law of Inheritance (Amendment) Act, (Act II of 1929), the place of the paternal uncle 's son in the line of heirs under the Mitakshara Law of Succession is much higher than that of the sister 's son and the Mayukha Law, which prevails in the State of Bombay, does not make any difference in this re spect."
REASONING,"Under the Mitakshara Law, the paternal uncle comes just after the paternal grandfather and his son follows him immediately."
REASONING,"By Act II of 1929, however, four other rela tions have been introduced between the grandfather and the paternal uncle and they are the son 's daughter, daughter 's daughter, sister and sister 's son, and the paternal uncle and his son are thus postponed to these four relations by the Hindu Law of Inheritance Act of 1929."
REASONING,"The question is, whether the provisions of this Act can at all be invoked to determine the heirs of a Hindu female in respect of her stridhan property."
REASONING,"The object of the Act as stated in the preamble is to alter the order in which certain heirs of a Hindu male dying intestate are entitled to succeed to his estate; and section 1 (2) expressly lays down that ""the Act applies only to persons who but for the passing of this Act would have been subject to the Law of Mitakshara in respect of the provisions herein enacted, and it applies to such persons in respect only of the property of males not held in coparcenary and not disposed of by will""."
REASONING,Thus the scope of the Act is limited.
REASONING,It governs succession only to the separate property of a Hindu male who dies intestate.
REASONING,"It does (1) See Viramitrodaya, Chap."
REASONING,"V, Part II, Sec. 9."
REASONING,"(2) See Mayne 's Hindu Law, 11th edition, article 621, page 741."
REASONING,216 not alter the law as regards the devolution of any other kind of property owned by a Hindu male and does not purport to regulate succession to the property of a Hindu female at all.
REASONING,It is to be noted that the Act does not make these four relations statutory heirs under the Mitakshara Law under all circumstances and for all purposes;it makes them heirs only when the propositus is a male and the property in respect to which it is sought to be applied is his separate property.
REASONING,"Whether this distinction between male and female propositus is at all reasonable is another matter, but the language of the Act makes this distinction expressly and so long as the language is clear and unambiguous, no other consideration is at all relevant."
REASONING,"This is the view which has been taken, and in our opinion quite rightly, in a number of cases of the Madras, Patna and Nagput High Courts(1)."
REASONING,"We are not unmindful of the fact that a contrary view has been expressed in certain decisions of the Bombay, Lahore and Allahabad High Courts (2)."
REASONING,"The line of reasoning that is adopted in most of the decisions where the contrary view is taken can be thus stated in the language of Mr. Justice Somjee (3):__ ""The Act is not sought to be applied to determine the succession to the stridhan of a Hindu maiden but is sought to be used by the petitioner to ascertain the fourth class of heirs to the stridhan of a Hindu maiden mentioned at page 139 of Mulla 's Hindu Law."
REASONING,The heirs of the father at the time of her death have to be ascertained in accordance with the Hindu Law as it existed at the time of the death of Bai Champubai.
REASONING,"Thus the Act comes into operation for ascer taining the order in which the heirs of her father would be entitled to succeed to his estate, because the heirs of the father (1) Vide Manda Mahalakshmamma vs Mantravadi (I.L.R. ; Shakuntalabai vs Court of Wards (I.L.R. 1942 Nag. 629); Talukraj Kuer vs Bacha Kuer (I.L.R. 26 Pat."

REASONING,""" It is true that we have got to ascertain who the heirs of the father are at the date when the daughter dies, but the enquiry is for the purpose of finding out who the suc cessor to the estate of the daughter is."
REASONING,"This being the subject of the enquiry, the operation of Act II of 1029 is excluded by its express terms and for that purpose the Act is to be treated as non existent."
REASONING,"In other words, the stridhan heirs are to be ascertained with reference to the general provisions of the Hindu Law of Inheritance ignoring the statutory heirs who have been introduced by the Act."
REASONING,"The fallacy in the line of approach adopted in these cases seems to be that they treat the Inheritance Act of 1929 as amending or altering the Mitakshara Law of succession in all cases and for all purposes, whereas the Act has absolutely no operation when succession to the separate property of a male is not the subject matter of investigation."
REASONING,The result is that in our opinion the plaintiffs are not the nearest heirs of Bhimabai even assuming that the property was non watan and belonged to her absolutely.
RPC,The appeal will thus stand dismissed.

JUDGE,The Judgment of the Court was deliv ered by FAZL ALl J.
FACTS,"This is an appeal against the judgment of the High Court at Patiala upholding the conviction and sentence of the appellant, who was tried by the Sessions Judge of Sangrut for the offence of murder and sentenced to death."
FACTS,"373 The prosecution story is a somewhat long and complicated one, but ignoring unnecessary details, the material facts may be shortly stated as follows : On the 5th October, 1949, there was a quarrel between the appellant and one Darbara Singh, in the course of which the appellant attacked the latter with a phawra (a cutting instrument)."
FACTS,"About that time, Gurmail Singh, the deceased person, returned to his house, which was close to the house of Darbara Singh, from his cotton field, where he had been working, in order to take tea for his companions who were still working in his field."
FACTS,"The appellant asked Gutmail Singh to lend him a spear to enable him to kill Darbara Singh, but since the latter refused to do so, there ensued a quarrel between him and the appellant, in the course of which they exchanged abuses and grappled with each other, and the fight was stopped only by the intervention of cer tain persons present at the place."
FACTS,"It appears that the appellant was greatly affected by this quarrel, and thereaf ter he is said to have armed himself with a rifle and at tacked 3 persons in the vicinity of Gurmail Singh 's cotton field."
FACTS,"He fired firstly at Kartar Singh, son of Satwan Singh, while the latter was returning to his house from the field of Gutmail Singh, but he was not hurt."
FACTS,"Soon after that, while Gurmail Singh was returning to his field after attending to his buffaloes in a garden which was nearby, the appellant chased him and fired at him thereby causing his instantaneous death."
FACTS,"Lastly, he is said to have fired at Kartar Singh, son of Bishan Singh and one Jangir Singh, while they were raising an alarm, but the bullet missed them."
FACTS,"Upon these allegations, the following three charges were framed against him : ""(1) That you. fired a shot at Gurmail Singh deceased with rifle P.I. with the intention of killing him and caused his death and thereby committed an offence pun ishable under section 302. (2) That you. fired a shot at Kartar Singh and Jangir Singh with rifle P.I. with the intention of causing death and made an attempt to cause their death 374 section 307. . (3) That you. . fired a gun shot at Kartar Singh s/o Satwan Singh. with the intention of killing him and made an attempt to cause his death and thereby committed an offence punishable under section 307. "" It appears that the appellant was an Instructor in the Home Guards."
FACTS,and the rifle which he is said to have used had been given to him by his superior officer with 20 rounds of ammunition.
FACTS,"To support their version of the occurrence, the prosecu tion examined 3 eye witnesses whose evidence has been ac cepted by both the courts below after careful scrutiny."
FACTS,"The learned Sessions Judge acquitted the appellant of the second and third charges under section 307 of the Indian Penal Code, holding that there was no convincing evidence that the appellant intended to murder Jangit Singh and the other 2 persons."
FACTS,"He however convicted him of the first charge under section 302 of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced him to death, which sentence was later confirmed by the High Court."
FACTS,"The learned counsel for the appellant had very little to argue on the merits of the case, but he seriously contended that there had been a misjoinder of charges which could not be tried together under the law, and the illegality so committed had vitiated the whole trial of the appellant."
FACTS,"It appears that in the High Court, the line of argument on this point was somewhat different from the line adopted in this court."
REASONING,"What was stressed in that court seems to have been that the three incidents in respect of which the appellant was charged not having happened in the course of the same transaction, they could not have been properly made the subject of one trial, and for this contention reliance was placed mainly on section 235 (1)of the Criminal Procedure Code, which provides that ""if, in one series of acts so connected together as to form the same transaction, more offences than one are committed by the same person, he may be at one trial for, every such offence."
REASONING,""" It should be noted 375 that that section is only one of the exceptions to the general rule laid down in section 233 of the Code that for every distinct offence, there shall be a separate charge and every such charge shall be tried separately."
REASONING,"In this court, no reference was made to section 235, but the argument was confined to the question as to whether the present case falls within another exception of section 23 '3 which is contained in section 234 (1) which runs as 'follows : ""When a person is accused of more offences than one of the same kind committed within the space of twelve months from the first to the last of such offences, whether in respect of the same person or not, he may be charged with, and tried at one trial for any number of them not exceeding three."
ARG,""" It was argued before us that even though only 3 charges have been framed against the appellant, he has in fact been tried for 4 offences and not 3."
ARG,"The 4 offences are said to be these : (1) Committing the murder of Gurmail Singh; (2) Attempting to murder Kartar Singh, son of Sarwan Singh; (3) Attempting to murder Jangit Singh; and (4) Attempting to murder Kartar Singh, son of Bishan Singh."
ARG,"The learned counsel contended that the fact that the appellant has been acquitted of the last 3 offences and convicted only of the first offence was immaterial to the point raised by him, and we have only to see whether all the offences mentioned above could be properly tried together."
ARG,"In our opinion, the short reply to this contention is that the second charge which relates to the appellant firing at Kartar Singh and Jangir Singh is not a charge with respect to 2 offences but is a charge with respect to one offence only."
ARG,The evidence adduced by the prosecution shows that the appellant fired only one bullet.
REASONING,"The word ""offence"" has been defined in the Criminal Procedure Code as meaning ""any act or omission made punishable by any law for the time being in force""."
REASONING,There seems to be 49 376 nothing wrong in law to regard the single act of firing by the appellant as one offence only.
REASONING,"On the other hand, we think that it would be taking an extremely narrow and arti ficial view to split it into 2 offences."
PRECEDENT,"There are several reported cases in which a similar view has been taken, and in our opinion they have not been incorrectly decided."
PRECEDENT,"In Queen Empress vs Raghu Rai(1), where a person stole several bullocks from the same herdsman at the same time, it was held that only one offence had been committed."
PRECEDENT,"In Promotha Nath Ray vs King Emperor(2), it was held that misappropria tion in regard to several account books constituted only one offence."
PRECEDENT,"In Johan Subarna vs King EmPeror(3), it was held that when an attempt to cheat a number of men by speaking to them in a body had been committed, one joint charge was valid."
PRECEDENT,"In Poonit Singh vs Madho Bhot (4), it was held that only one offence had been committed by a person who gave false information in one statement to the police against 2 persons."
PRECEDENT,"In Sudheendrakumar Ray vs Emperor(5), a person who was chased by 2 constables had fired at them several times, but it seems to have been rightly assumed that the firing did not constitute more than one offence, though the point was not specifically raised or decided."
REASONING,"In our opinion, there is no substance in the point raised, though we should not be understood as laying down the wide proposition that in no case can a single act constitute more than one of fence."
REASONING,"The other points urged on behalf of the appellant before us were somewhat unsubstantial points relating to the merits of the case, which it is not usual for this court to allow to be raised in appeals by special leave."
REASONING,"In our opinion, this appeal is without merit, and it is accordingly dismissed."
RPC,Appeal dismissed.

JUDGE,BOSE J. delivered judgment as fol lows.
JUDGE,FAZL ALI J. agreed.
JUDGE,BOSE J.
FACTS,The appellant Rameshwar was charged with com mitting rape on a young girl Mst.
FACTS,"Purni, eight years of age."
RLC,"He was committed to Sessions and was convicted by the As sistant Sessions Judge, Sawai Jaipur, and sentenced to one year 's rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 250."
FACTS,"An appeal was made to the Sessions Judge at Jaipur, that being the appropriate appellate tribunal in that area."
FACTS,"The learned Sessions Judge held that the evidence was sufficient for moral conviction but fell short of legal proof because, in his opinion, the law requires corroboration of the story of the prosecution in such cases as a matter of precaution and the corroborative evidence, in so far as it sought to connect the appellant with the crime, was legally insuffi cient though morally enough."
FACTS,He was satisfied however that the girl had been raped by somebody.
FACTS,"Accordingly, he acquit ted the accused giving him the benefit of the doubt."
FACTS,The State of Sawal Jaipur and Gangapur appealed against the acquittal to the High Court at Jaipur.
FACTS,380 The learned High Court Judges held that the law requires corroboration in such cases but held that the girl 's state ment made to her mother was legally admissible as corrobora tion and considering that sufficient they set aside the acquittal and restored the conviction and sentence.
FACTS,The High Court later granted leave to appeal under article 134 (1)(c) of the Constitution as the case involved questions of law of general importance.
FACTS,The first point taken before us related to the admissi bility of the evidence of the girl herself.
FACTS,Her age was stated to be seven or eight years at the time of the exami nation by the learned Assistant Sessions Judge who recorded her testimony.
FACTS,He certified that she did not understand the sanctity of an oath and accordingly did not administer one to her.
FACTS,He did not certify that the child understood the duty of speaking the truth.
FACTS,"The proviso to section 5 of the , prescribes that ""Provided that where the witness is a child under twelve years of age, and the Court or person having authority to examine such witness is of opinion that, though he understands the duty of speaking the truth, he does not understand the nature of an oath or affirmation, the forego ing provisions of this section and the provisions of section 6 shall not apply to such witness, but in any such case the absence of an oath or affirmation shall not render inadmis sible any evidence given by such witness nor affect the obligation of the witness to state the truth."
REASONING,""" The question is whether the opinion referred to must be formally recorded or whether it can be inferred from the circumstances in which the deposition was taken."
REASONING,The proviso quoted above must be read along with section 118 of the Evidence Act and section 13 of the Oaths Act.
REASONING,"In my opinion, an omission to administer an oath, even to an adult, goes only to the credibility of the witness and not his competency."
REASONING,The question of competency is dealt with in section 118.
REASONING,"Every 381 witness is competent unless the Court considers he is pre vented from understanding the questions put to him, or from giving rational answers by reason of tender years, extreme old age, disease whether of body or mind, or any other cause of the same kind."
REASONING,It will be observed that there is always competency in fact unless the court considers otherwise.
REASONING,"No other ground of incompetency is given, therefore, unless the Oaths Act adds additional grounds of incompetency it is evident that section 118 must prevail."
REASONING,Now the Oaths Act does not deal with competency.
REASONING,Its main object is to render persons who give false evidence liable to prosecution.
REASONING,"It is true a subsidiary object is to bring home to the witness the solemnity of the occasion and to impress upon him the duty of speaking the truth, but in view of section 118 these matters only touch credibility and not admissibility."
REASONING,"In my opinion, section 13 of the Oaths Act places this beyond doubt."
REASONING,"It states ""No omission to take any oath or make any affirmation. . and no irregularity whatever, in the form in which any one of them is administered, shall invali date any proceeding or render inadmissible any evidence whatever. . "" Section 5 is the main provision regarding the adminis tration of oaths."
REASONING,The proviso only sets out the cases in which the oath is not to be administered.
REASONING,"If, therefore, an omission to take the oath does not affect the admissibility of the evidence, it follows that irregularity of the kind we are considering which arises out of the proviso cannot affect the admissibility either."
REASONING,Section 118 remains and unless the judge considers otherwise the witness is compe tent.
REASONING,I do not think it will be useful to consider English authorities on the point because we are governed here by the terms of the various sections I have referred to.
REASONING,But a decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privyi Council is in point.
PRECEDENT,"Their Lordships stated in Mohamed Sugal Esa vs The King(1) : (1) A.I.R. 1946 P.C. 3 at 5 382 ""Section 13, Oaths Act, is quite unqualified in its terms and there is nothing to suggest that it is to apply only where the omission to administer the oath occurs per incuriam."
REASONING,"If that had been the intention of the Legislature, it would have been simple to insert words in the section to that effect. ."
REASONING,It may be observed that this question can no longer arise in India because in 1939 the Legislature passed the Oaths (Amendment) Act (Act XXXIX of 1939) which settles the law in accordance with the Bengal and Oudh decisions referred to above.
PRECEDENT,""" The decisions to which their Lordships refer are and Ram Samujh vs Emperor(2)."
REASONING,The decisions there were that the section being unqualified in terms did apply to a case where the Court accepted the evidence of a child to whom the oath was not administered on the ground that the witness did not understand its nature.
REASONING,"The principle of the decisions ap plies here because, as their Lordships observe, the section is unqualified in its terms."
REASONING,"I would add however that it is desirable that judges and magistrates should always record their opinion that the child understands the duty of speaking the truth and state why they think that, otherwise the credibility of the wit ness may be seriously affected, so much so, that in some cases it may be necessary to reject the evidence altogether."
REASONING,"But whether the magistrate or judge really was of that opinion can, I think, be gathered from the circumstances when there is no formal certificate."
REASONING,"In the present case, it is plain that the learned Judge had the proviso in mind because he certified that the witness does not understand the nature of an oath and so did not administer one but despite that went on to take her evidence."
REASONING,"It is also an important fact that the accused, who was represented by counsel, did not object."
REASONING,Had he raised the point the Judge would doubtless have made good the omission.
REASONING,I am of opinion that Mst.
REASONING,Purni was a competent witness and that her evi dence is admissible.
REASONING,"In (1) F.N. (2) (1907) 10 O.C. 337 383 the Privy Council case which I have just cited, their Lord ships said ""It is not to be supposed that any judge would accept as a witness a person who he considered was incapable not only of understanding the nature of an oath but also the necessi ty of speaking the truth when examined as a witness."
REASONING,""" That is the very point here."
REASONING,One can presume that the learned Judge had that in mind from the fact that he exam ined the child after referring to a fact which arises out of the proviso.
REASONING,"As regards her credibility, the learned trial Judge, who recorded her evidence and saw her in the box, has believed her, so has the High Court; and it is important to note that the learned Sessions Judge who acquitted the accused has not disbelieved her."
REASONING,On the contrary he says he is morally convinced.
REASONING,All he says is that in the absence of corrobora tion it will be unsafe to convict because the Privy Council and other cases advise corroboration as a matter of pru dence.
REASONING,"We were taken carefully through the evidence, as elabo rately as in a court of first appeal."
REASONING,I am of opinion that the learned High Court Judges were fully justified in ac cepting the evidence of Purni and in believing her mother Mst.
REASONING,Ghisi.
REASONING,I consider it unnecessary to recapitulate their reasons.
REASONING,After the careful analysis given by three Courts it is sufficient to say that I agree with the learned High Court Judges.
REASONING,We are left therefore with the questions of law.
REASONING,The first question is whether the law requires corrobo ration in these cases.
REASONING,Now the Evidence Act now here says so.
REASONING,"On the other hand, when dealing with the testimony of an accomplice, though it says in section 114 (b) that the Court may presume that an accomplice is unworthy of credit unless he is corroborated in material particulars, it makes it clear in section 133 that ""An accomplice shall be a competent witness against an accused person; and a conviction is not 50 384 illegal merely because it proceeds upon the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice."
REASONING,""" Now a woman who has been raped is not an accomplice."
REASONING,If she was ravished she is the victim of an outrage.
REASONING,"If she consented there is no offence unless she is a married woman, in which case questions of adultery may arise."
REASONING,But adultery presupposes consent and so is not on the same footing as rape.
REASONING,"In the case of a girl who is below the age of consent, her consent will not matter so far as the offence of rape is concerned, but if she consented her testimony will natural ly be as suspect as that of an accomplice."
REASONING,So also in the case of unnatural offences.
REASONING,But in all these cases a large volume of case law has grown up which treats the evidence of the complainant somewhat along the same lines as accomplice evidence though often for widely differing reasons and the position now reached is that the rule about corroboration has hardened into one of law.
REASONING,"But it is important to under stand exactly what the rule is and what the expression ""hardened into a rule of law"" means."
REASONING,"In my judgment, this branch of the law is the same as in England and I am of opinion that the lucid exposition of it given by Lord Reading, the Lord Chief Justice of England, in The King vs Baskerville(1) cannot be bettered."
REASONING,"In that case, Baskerville had been convicted of having committed acts of gross indecency with the two boys."
REASONING,(There the boys were accomplices because they were freely consent ing parties and there was no use of force).
REASONING,"The learned Chief Justice says at page 663 : ""There is no doubt that the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice is admissible in law."
REASONING,"But it has long been a rule of practice at common law for the judge to warn the jury of the danger of convicting a prisoner on the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice or accomplices, and, in the discretion of the judge, to advise them not to convict upon such evidence; but the judge should point out to the jury that it is (1) 385 within their legal province to convict upon such unconfirmed evidence."
REASONING,"This rule of practice has become virtually equivalent to a rule of law, and since the Court of Criminal Appeal came into operation this Court has held that, in the absence of such a warning by the judge, the conviction must be quashed."
REASONING,"If after the proper caution by the judge the jury nevertheless convict the prisoner, this Court will not quash the conviction merely upon the ground that the accom plice 's testimony was uncorroborated."
REASONING,""" That, in my opinion, is exactly the law in India so far as accomplices are concerned and it is certainly not any higher in the case of sexual offences."
REASONING,The only clarifica tion necessary for purposes of this country is where this class of offence is sometimes tried by a judge without the aid of a jury.
REASONING,In these cases it is necessary that the judge should give some indication in his judgment that he has had this rule of caution in mind and should proceed to give reasons for considering it unnecessary to require corroboration on the facts of the particular case before him and show why he considers it safe to convict without corrob oration in that particular case.
REASONING,"I am of opinion that the learned High Court Judges were wrong in thinking that they could not, as a matter of law, convict without corrobora tion."
PRECEDENT,There is a class of cases which considers that though corroboration should ordinarily be required in the case of a grown up woman it is unnecessary in the case of a child of tender years.
PRECEDENT,Bishram.
PRECEDENT,vs Emperor(1) is typical of that point of view.
PRECEDENT,"On the other hand, the Privy Council has said in Mohamed Sugal Esa vs The King(2) that as a matter of prudence a conviction should not ordinarily be based on the uncorroborated evidence of a child witness."
PRECEDENT,"In my opinion, the true rule is that in every case of this type the rule about the advisability of corroboration should be present to the mind of the judge."
PRECEDENT,In a jury case he must tell the (1) A.I.R. 1944 Nag. 363.
PRECEDENT,(2) A.I.R. 1946 P.C. 3 at 5.
REASONING,386 jury of it and in a non jury case he must show that it is present to his mind by indicating that in his judgment.
REASONING,"But he should also point out that corroboration can be dispensed with if, in the particular circumstances of the case before him, either the jury, or, when there is no jury, he himself, is satisfied that it is safe to do so."
REASONING,"The rule, which according to the cases has hardened into one of law, is not that corroboration is essential before there can be a con viction but that the necessity of corroboration, as a matter of prudence, except where the circumstances make it safe to dispense with it, must be present to the mind of the judge, and in jury cases, must find place in the charge, before a conviction without corroboration can be sustained."
REASONING,"The tender years of the child, coupled with other circumstances appearing in the case, such, for example, as its demeanour, unlikelihood of tutoring and so forth, may render corrobora tion unnecessary but that is a question of fact in every case."
REASONING,The only rule of law is that this rule of prudence must be present to the mind of the judge or the jury as the case may be and be understood and appreciated by him or them.
REASONING,"There is no rule of practice that there must, in every case, be corroboration before a conviction can be allowed to stand."
REASONING,I turn next to the nature and extent of the corrobora tion required when it is not considered safe to dispense with it.
REASONING,"Here, again, the rules are lucidly expounded by Lord Reading in Baskerville 's case(1) at pages 664 to 669."
REASONING,It would be impossible.
REASONING,"indeed it would be dangerous, to formulate the kind of evidence which should, or would, be regarded as corroboration."
REASONING,Its nature and extent must necessarily vary with circumstances of each case and also according to the particular circumstances of the offence charged.
REASONING,But to this extent the rules are clear.
REASONING,"First, it is not necessary that there should be inde pendent confirmation of every material circumstance in the sense that the independent evidence in the case, apart from the testimony of the complainant or the (1) , 387 accomplice, should in itself be sufficient to sustain con viction."
REASONING,"As Lord Reading says ``Indeed, if it were required that the accomplice should be confirmed in every detail of the crime, his evidence would not be essential to the case, it would be merely confirmatory of other and independent testimony."
REASONING,""" All that is required is that there must be ""some addi tional evidence rendering it probable that the story of the accomplice (or complainant) is true and that it is reasona bly safe to act upon it."
REASONING,""" Secondly, the independent evidence must not only make it safe to believe that the crime was committed but must in some way reasonably connect or tend to connect the accused with it by confirming in some material particular the testi mony of the accomplice or complainant that the accused committed the crime."
REASONING,This does not mean that the corrobora tion as to identity must extend to all the circumstances necessary to identify the accused with the offence.
REASONING,"Again, all that is necessary is that there should be independent evidence which will make it reasonably safe to believe the witness 's story that the accused was the one, or among those, who committed the offence."
REASONING,"The reason for this part of the rule is that ""a man who has been guilty of a crime himself will always be able to relate the facts of the case, and if the confirmation be only on the truth of that history, without identifying the persons, that is really no corroboration at all."
REASONING,It would not at all tend to show that the party ac cused participated in it.
REASONING,""" Thirdly, the corroboration must come from independent sources and thus ordinarily the testimony of one accomplice would not be sufficient to corroborate that of another."
REASONING,But of course the circumstances may be such as to make it safe to dispense with the necessity of corroboration and in those special circumstances a conviction so based would not be illegal.
REASONING,I say this because it was contended that the mother in this case was not an independent source.
REASONING,"388 Fourthly, the corroboration need not be direct evidence that the accused committed the crime."
REASONING,It is sufficient if it is merely circumstantial evidence of his connection with the crime.
REASONING,"Were it otherwise, ""many crimes which are usually committed between accomplices in secret, such as incest, offences with females"" (or unnatural offences) ""could never be brought to justice."" Next, I turn to another aspect of the case."
REASONING,The learned High Court Judges have used Mst.
REASONING,Purni 's statement to her mother as corroboration of her statement.
REASONING,"The ques tion arises, can the previous statement of an accomplice, or a complainant, be accepted as corroboration ? That the evidence is legally admissible as evidence of conduct is indisputable because of Illustration (j) to section 8 of the Evidence Act which is in these terms: ""The question is whether A was ravished."
REASONING,"The facts that, shortly after the alleged rape, she made a complaint relating to the crime, the circumstances under which, and the terms in which, the complaint was made are relevant."
REASONING,""" But that is not the whole problem."
REASONING,"for we are concerned here not only with its legal admissibility and relevancy as to conduct but as to its admissibility for a particular purpose, namely corroboration."
REASONING,The answer to that is to be found in section 157 of the Evidence Act which lays down the law for India.
REASONING,"Section 157 states that ""In order to corroborate the testimony of a witness, any former statement made by such witness relating to the same fact at or about the time when the fact took place, or before any authority legally competent to investigate the fact, may be proved."
REASONING,""" The section makes no exceptions, therefore, provided the condition prescribed, that is to say, ""at or about the time etc. ,"" are fulfilled there can be no doubt that such a statement is legally admissible in India as corroboration."
REASONING,"The weight to be attached to it is, of course, another matter and it may be that in some 389 cases the evidentiary value of two statements emanating from the same tainted source may not be high, but in view of section 118 its legal admissibility as corroboration cannot be questioned."
REASONING,"To state this is, however, no more than to emphasise that there is no rule of thumb in these cases."
REASONING,"When corroborative evidence is produced it also has to be weighed and in a given case, as with other evidence, even though it is legally admissible for the purpose on hand its weight may be nil."
REASONING,"On the other hand, seeing that corrobo ration is not essential to a conviction, conduct of this kind may be more than enough in itself to justify acceptance of the complainant 's story."
REASONING,It all depends on the facts of the case.
REASONING,"In the present case, Mst."
REASONING,Purni told 'her mother about the incident about four hours after it occurred.
REASONING,The reason for the delay was that her mother was not at home when she went there.
REASONING,She says that when she went home she lay down and went to sleep and that when her mother returned she asked her why she was sleeping and then she told her mother what had happened.
REASONING,Her mother tells much the same story.
REASONING,She says she had gone out to her field in the morning and did not return till about 4 p.m.
REASONING,When she reach home she found her daughter lying there weeping.
REASONING,She has been be lieved by the learned trial Judge as also by the High Court and has not been disbelieved by the learned Sessions Judge.
REASONING,"All he says is that she is not an ""independent"" witness and is therefore not sufficient for corroboration."
REASONING,"The first question is whether this delay fulfills the ""at or about"" condition."
REASONING,"In my opinion, here also there can be no hard and fast rule."
REASONING,The main test is whether the statement was made as early as can reasonably be expected in the circumstances of the case and before there was opportu nity for tutoring or concoction.
REASONING,"It was suggested that the child could have complained to some women who were working in the neighbourhood, but that would not be natural in a child."
REASONING,She would be frightened and her first instinct would be to run home to her mother.
REASONING,The High Court 390 was satisfied on these points and so am I.
REASONING,"Consequently, the matter does fall within the ambit of section 157 read with section 8, Illustration (j)."
REASONING,"The next question is whether the mother can be regard ed as an ""independent"" witness."
REASONING,"So far as this case is con cerned, I have no doubt on that score."
REASONING,It may be that all mothers may not be sufficiently independent to fulfill the requirements of the corroboration rule but there is no legal bar to exclude them from its operation merely on the ground of their relationship.
REASONING,Independent merely means independent of sources which are likely to be tainted.
REASONING,In the absence of enmity against the accused there is no reason why she should implicate him falsely.
REASONING,It is true the ac cused suggested that they were on bad terms but that has not been believed by anyone.
REASONING,The third question is whether there is independent corroboration connecting the accused with the crime.
REASONING,The only corroboration relied on for that is the previous state ment of the child to her mother.
REASONING,That might not always be enough but this rule can be waived in a given case just as much as the necessity for any corroboration at all.
REASONING,"In the present case, the learned High Court Judges would have acted on the uncorroborrated testimony of the girl had they not felt pressed by the corroboration rule."
REASONING,Viewing all the circumstances I am satisfied that the High Court was right.
REASONING,"I am satisfied that in this case, considering the conduct of the girl and her mother from start to finish, no corrobora tion beyond the statement of the child to her mother was necessary."
REASONING,I am satisfied that the High Court was right in holding that that was enough to make it safe to act on her testimony.
REASONING,"I would dismiss the appeal and direct the appellant to surrender to his bail in accordance with the terms of his bond, serve out his sentence and pay the fine."
RPC,I agree.
RPC,Appeal dismissed.

COUNSEL,"S.P. Sinha (G.C. Mathur, with him), for the appellant."
COUNSEL,"K.B. Asthana, for the respondent."
JUDGE,The Judgment of the Court was deliv ered by FAZL ALl J.
FACTS,This is an appeal against a judgment of the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad reversing the decision of the Sessions Judge of Aligarh in a criminal case.
FACTS,"The appellants were tried by the Sessions Judge on charges under section 302 read with section 149, section 148, sections 325 and 326 read with section 149, and section 201 of the Indian Penal Code, but were acquitted."
FACTS,"On appeal by the State Government, the High Court reversed the Sessions Judge 's decision, and convicted the appellants and sentenced them to transportation for life under section 302 read with section 149, to five years ' rigorous imprisonment under sections 325 and 326 read with section 149, and to two years ' rigorous imprisonment under section 147 of the Indian Penal Code, all the sentences being made to run concurrently."
FACTS,"The appellants thereafter applied to the Privy Council for special leave, which was granted on the 28th October, 1947."
FACTS,The facts which were put before the court on behalf of the prosecution may be briefly stated as follows.
FACTS,"There is a plot No. 518 in Nagaria Patti Chaharum, village Shahgarh in the district of Aligarh which is about 30 bighas in area and is known as the ""teesa"" field."
FACTS,"This plot was the ""sir"" land of several landlords including Mst."
FACTS,Bhagwati Kuer and Ratan Singh and had been let out to certain tenants.
FACTS,"In 1944, Mst."
FACTS,"Bhagwati Kuer, Ratan Singh and their co sharers filed a suit for the ejectment of the tenants, and the 195 suit was decreed."
FACTS,"On the 7th June, 1945, possession over the plot was delivered by the Amin to Surajpal Singh, the first appellant, who was the mukhtar i Am of Mst."
FACTS,Bhagwati Kuer.
FACTS,"It was contended on behalf of Surajpal Singh that he took possession on behalf of all the co sharers, but certain statements made by Ratan Singh in his evidence do not sup port this contention."
FACTS,"However that may be, it appears that on the 17th June, 1945, Ratan Singh reported to the police that he had sent his labourers to irrigate the ""teesa"" field, and while they were irrigating it Surajpal Singh and certain other persons came and tried to stop the irrigation and damaged the ploughs of Ratan Singh."
FACTS,"On the 18th June, at about 7 A.M., the occurrence which is the subject matter of the present trial took place."
FACTS,"The prosecution version of the occurrence was that while Ratan Singh 's labourers were working in the field under the supervision of one Behari Singh, the appellants with many other persons came armed with guns, spears and lathis, and some of the members of the appellants ' party entered the field, cut off the nosestrings of the bullocks and abused and assaulted the labourers, most of whom ran away."
FACTS,"Thereupon, Deva Sukh, who was there to supply water to the labourers, protested and was beaten with lathis."
FACTS,"At that point of time, Behari Singh and 10 to 15 persons came and fight took place between the parties."
FACTS,"During the fight, one of the accused persons, Rajendra Singh, a young lad, fired his gun twice in the air, and thereafter Surajpal Singh took the gun from him and fired two shots hitting Nawab Mewati, who died instantaneously, and Behari Singh, who died later in the day."
FACTS,"Three other persons, Zorawar, Rajpal and Lakhan also received gun shot injuries."
FACTS,"Sometime later, Surajpal Singh along with the other three appellants came to the spot and removed the dead body of Nawab in a cart."
FACTS,"The body was thrown into a river and was recovered on the 20th June, 1945."
FACTS,After investiga tion 25 persons including the appellants were sent up for trial.
FACTS,"After hearing the evidence in the case, the Ses sions Judge delivered judgment on the 20th February, 1946."
FACTS,"196 He held that the ""teesa"" field was in the possession of Surajpal Singh, that Behari Singh and Ratan Singh 's men were aggressors and wished to take forcible possession of the field, that when resisted they had attacked the appellants ' party, that the person who fired the gun had done so in self defence and not with a view to killing Behari Singh and Nawab Mewati, and that the evidence adduced by the prosecu tion was so unsatisfactory that it was unsafe to convict the accused upon it."
FACTS,"As to the charge of concealing evidence of the offence of murder by the removal of the dead body of Nawab, the Sessions Judge expressed the opinion that in order to convict a person on that charge it must be proved that the offence, the evidence of which the accused is alleged to have caused to disappear had actually been com mitted, but since in the present case the charge of murder was not proved the accused could not be convicted for having caused disappearance of evidence connected with it."
RLC,The Judge also held that the evidence being unreliable the charge under section 201 of the Indian Penal Code had not been established beyond reasonable doubt.
RLC,"The High Court delivered its judgment on the 8th May, 1947, allowing the appeal of the State Government."
RLC,"Shortly stated, the conclusion arrived at by the High Court was that Ratan Singh had as much right to the possession of the field as Bhagwati Kuer, that both parties were trying to take exclusive possession of the field, that both parties were prepared for all contingencies to vindicate and enforce their rights, and hence the question of possession was wholly immaterial and no right of private defence could be successfully pleaded by the appellants."
REASONING,"A perusal of the two judgments before us shows that while the Sessions Judge took great pains to discuss all the important aspects of the case and to record his opinion on every material point, the learned Judges of the High Court have reversed his decision without displacing the very substantial reasons given by him in support of his conclu sion."
REASONING,The difference in the treatment of the case by the two courts below 197 is particularly noticeable in the manner in which they have dealt with the prosecution evidence.
REASONING,"We find that while the Sessions Judge took up the evidence of each witness and recorded his finding with regard to his credibility after discussing the minutest details of the evidence, all that the learned Judges of the High Court have to say about the prosecution evidence as a whole is as follows : ""In Prag Dat 's case their Lordships observed: usual in cases of this kind the police have found it difficult to secure independent testimony of what did take place."
REASONING,Those of the villagers who were present and looking on would probably by sympathy and bias be so attached to one or other of the disputing parties that it would be hopeless to get disinterested and reliable evidence from them. ' This difficulty the police find in most riot cases and this case is not free from it.
REASONING,"But as in Prag Dat 's case, in this case there are four witnesses, viz., Deo Sukh, Rori Singh, Ram Singh, and Ratan Singh, who could be characte rised as independent witnesses and they support the case for the prosecution, in the main."
REASONING,In our judgment their testimo ny is on the whole worthy of credence and sufficient to justify the conviction of the respondents.
REASONING,""" In view of the summary treatment of the evidence by the High Court, we had to read the evidence adduced in the case with great care, and what we find is that the four witness es, whose evidence has been accepted by the High Court, are just the persons against whom very serious criticism was offered by the Sessions Judge."
REASONING,"Of these witnesses, Ratan Singh not being an eye witness may be ruled out."
REASONING,"As to the remaining witnesses, we are on the whole inclined to agree with the view expressed by the Sessions Judge."
REASONING,"According to the Sessions Judge, the manner in which Deva Sukh was brought into the picture and the circumstances attendant on his evidence, furnish strong reasons."
REASONING,for rejecting the prosecution version.
REASONING,"What has been held is that the whole case of the prosecution 26 198 that Deva Sukh had received injuries in the course of the alleged occurrence was false and his injuries ""were made up so as to create evidence of private defence"" to be utilized by the prosecution to meet the charge of having caused injuries to the members of the appellants ' party."
REASONING,It has been established that at least four persons on the side of the accused had received injuries.
REASONING,"Mahindarpal had received no less than 16 injuries, and his condition was serious for some time."
REASONING,"Karan Singh had 12 injuries, one of which was grievous."
REASONING,"Hari Singh had received 7 injuries including a grievous injury, and Nikka Singh also was injured, his injury having been noticed by the investigating sub inspec tor."
REASONING,"In the prosecution evidence, it was stated that many of the accused persons were armed with lathis and had used them, and it would be strange if it was not proved that any of the persons on their side had any injuries attributable to lathis."
REASONING,"It has been established that the four injured persons of Ratan Singh 's party, viz., Rajpal Singh, Lakhan Singh, Behari Singh and Zorawar Singh, had only gun shot wounds."
REASONING,"A serious question which arises in this case is at what stage the gun was used, and whether it was used in self defence after the members of the appellants ' party were assaulted with lathis or it was used before they were as saulted."
REASONING,The prosecution witnesses had to admit that at first a gun was fired twice in the air and then the actual firing took place.
REASONING,This version of the firing lends support to the defence story that the gun was fired in self defence when Ratan Singh 's men attacked members of the accused 's party.
REASONING,"The Sessions Judge has expressed the view that in order to meet the defence case the prosecution introduced the story of Deva Sukh having been assaulted with a lathi in the first instance so as to make the appellants ' party the aggressors, it being the prosecution case that Behari Singh and his men had used lathis in order to defend themselves."
REASONING,"In order to resolve the conflict in the cases of the parties and to get at the true picture, the 199 Sessions Judge went very minutely into the question as to whether there was trustworthy evidence about Deva Sukh having received any injury at all in the occurrence."
REASONING,It seems to us that there is a formidable array of circum stances to support the conclusion ultimately reached by the Sessions Judge.
REASONING,It appears that in the first information report there is no reference to Deva Sukh or to the injuries said to have been received by him.
REASONING,"The Sessions Judge has pointed out that there was a considerable interval of time between the occurrence and the lodging of the first informa tion report, and therefore it is surprising that the most important incident of the occurrence and the name of the most important witness was omitted in the report."
REASONING,"Again, no reference was made to Deva Sukh or to his injuries in the dying declaration of Behari Singh which was recorded by one Dr. Shankar Deo, and also in that of Lakhan Singh."
REASONING,"The Sessions Judge has further pointed out that the prosecution witnesses, Chokha, Prempal, Cheta and Gangola Singh, who were examined by the investigating officer on the 18th June, did not also refer to Deva Sukh."
REASONING,"The investigating sub inspector was informed of the injuries on Deva Sukh and his presence at the time of the occurrence for the first time on the 19th June, 1945, and Deva Sukh 's explanation for not appearing before him at the earliest opportunity was that he was frightened and had concealed himself in his house for about two days and had directed his relations not to inform the police of his presence."
REASONING,He also stated that on his arrival in his house after the occurrence he did not inform his relations of what had happened.
REASONING,"Some of these matters might have been overlooked if there had been convincing evidence about his having actually received injuries, but we are satisfied that such evidence as is before us is extreme ly unsatisfactory and suspicious and we entertain grave doubts as to whether Deva Sukh received any injuries at all."
REASONING,"Dr. Shanker Deo, who examined Deva Sukh, is a retired Sub Assistant Surgeon practising in Kauiraganj, which is not far from village Shahgarh."
REASONING,"200 He admits that he had known Ratan Singh since his childhood, and when he was a child he used to be taught at the house of Ratan Singh by a teacher employed by Ratan Singh 's uncle."
REASONING,"He has stated that Deva Sukh had two bruises across the back of the middle of the left forearm, and one of them was grievous since the left ulna was fractured."
REASONING,"He further says that at the time of examination he did charge fees from Deva Sukh, that he was brought to him three days after the other injured persons, that when the latter group of persons came to him none of them told him that there was one more injured person to be examined, and that Deva Sukh was brought to him by Ratan Singh 's servant."
REASONING,"There are unsatisfactory fea tures in the evidence of this doctor relating to other matters which need not be referred to, but what is somewhat remarkable is that though there is a District Board Hospital at Jalali about four miles from Kauirganj, Deva Sukh did not obtain an injury certificate from the doctor in charge of that hospital."
REASONING,"Deva Sukh says that he did go to that hospi tal to have his injuries attended to, but there is no evi dence to corroborate this."
REASONING,"These facts as well as a number of other facts relied upon by the Sessions Judge do go to support his theory, and once it is held that the prosecution has to rely on fabricated evidence, it throws doubts on the entire case."
REASONING,"From the record, it appears that Surajpal Singh was the person who had been taking an active interest in the eject ment suit, and he was admittedly spending money."
REASONING,"Ratan Singh says that he had also paid money to Surajpal Singh towards the expenditure, but this is not probable because he and Surajpal had been on bad terms."
REASONING,"It is admitted that Suraj pal is the person to whom the Amin gave possession of the land, but in spite of this fact, Ratan Singh 's men started operations on the land ignoring Bhagwati Kuer, which Ratan Singh had no right to do, even assuming that the land was joint property."
REASONING,"If Behari Singh and the other men sent by Ratan Singh were trying to take exclusive possession of the land and had started 201 operations thereon, Surajpal Singh had every right to pro test, and if his men were beaten first, of which there are strong indications in the case, he was entitled ' to repel the attack in exercise of the right of private defence."
REASONING,That Ratan Singh had made ample preparations through Behari Singh is quite clear.
REASONING,"Admittedly, there were a number of persons armed with lathis present at the scene on his behalf including outsiders like Nawab Mewati, who is said to have been a well known fighter, Zorawar and others."
REASONING,"As regards the remaining two witnesses, to whom the High Court has made reference, viz., Rori Singh and Pransukh, it seems to us that the High Court has overlooked the comments made by the Sessions Judge upon their evidence, some of which are of considerable force."
REASONING,"What has impressed us is that they were not independent witnesses and were not mentioned in the first information report as witnesses to the occurrence, and they were examined by the sub inspector as late as the 20th and 21st June, 1945."
REASONING,"After reading the two judgments, we see no reason why the opinion of the Sessions Judge regarding these witnesses should not receive the weight which should normally be attached to that of the trial court."
REASONING,"It is well established that in an appeal under section 417 of the Criminal Procedure Code, the High Court has full power to review the evidence upon which the order of acquit tal was founded, but it is equally well settled that the presumption of innocence of the accused is further rein forced by his acquittal by the trial court, and the findings of the trial court which had the advantage of seeing the witnesses and hearing their evidence can be reversed only for very substantial and compelling reasons."
REASONING,"On the whole, we are inclined to hold that the Sessions Judge had taken a reasonable view of the facts of the case, and in our opinion there were no good reasons for reversing that view."
REASONING,"The assessors with whose aid the trial was held, were unanimously of the opinion that the accused were not guilty, and 202 though 25 persons were placed on trial on identical evi dence, the State Government preferred an appeal only against 5 of them on the sole ground that the acquittal was against the weight of evidence on the record."
RPC,"In the result, we allow the appeal, set aside the con viction and sentences of the appellants and acquit them of all the charges."
RPC,Appeal allowed.
NAME,"P.D. Shamdasani vs Central Bank Of India Ltd on 21 December, 1951"
CITATION,"Equivalent citations: 1952 AIR 59, 1952 SCR 391"
COUNSEL,The petitioner in person.
COUNSEL,"C.K. Daphtary, Solicitor General of India, (J. B. Dadachanji, with him) for the respondent."
JUDGE,The Judgment of the Court was delivered by PATANJALI SASTRI.C.J.
FACTS,"This is a petition under article 32 of the Constitution for the enforcement of the petition er 's fundamental rights under article 19 (1) (f) and article 31(1) alleged to have been violated by the Central Bank of India Ltd., a company incorporated under the Indian Compa nies Act, 1882, and having its registered office at Bombay, (hereinafter referred to as ""the Bank"")."
FACTS,"It appears that the petitioner held five shares in the Share capital of the Bank which sold those shales to a 51 392 third party in purported exercise of its right of lien for recovery of a debt due to it from the petitioner, and the transfer was registered in the books of the Bank in the year 1937."
FACTS,The petitioner thereupon instituted a series of pro ceedings in the High Court at Bombay on its original and appellate jurisdiction challenging the validity of the said sale and transfer.
FACTS,"The latest of these proceedings was a suit filed against the Bank in 1951 wherein the plaint was rejected on 2nd March, 1951, under Order 7, Rule 11 (d), of the Code of Civil Procedure as barred by limitation."
FACTS,"The petitioner now prays that all the adverse orders made in the previous proceedings be quashed and the said High Court be directed to have ""the above suit set down to be heard as undefended and pronounce judgment against the respondent or to make such orders as it thinks fit in relation to the said suit""."
FACTS,"It may be mentioned here that though the aforesaid order rejecting the petitioner 's plaint was appealable, the petitioner did not prefer an appeal on the somewhat extraor dinary ground that ""the appeal if filed could not be heard by the Judges of the said Court as all of them were disqual ified from hearing such appeal"" either because of their interest in the Bank or because of their prejudice against him."
REASONING,We are of opinion that the petitioner has misconceived his remedy and the petition must fail on a preliminary ground.
REASONING,Neither article 19 (1) (f) nor article 31 (1) on its true construction was intended to prevent wrongful individual acts or to provide protection against merely private conduct.
REASONING,"Article 19 deals with the ""right to free dom"" and by clause (1) assures to the citizen certain funda mental freedoms including the freedom ""to acquire, hold and dispose of property"" subject to the power of the State to impose restrictions on the exercise of such rights to the extent and on the grounds mentioned in clauses (2) to (6)."
REASONING,"The language and structure of article 19 and its setting in Part III of the Constitution clearly show that the article was intended to protect those freedoms against State action other than in the legitimate exercise of its power to regu late private rights in the public interest, 393 Violation of rights of property by individuals is not within the purview of the article."
REASONING,The position is no better under article 31 (1).
REASONING,"The petitioner has urged that clause (1) should be construed apart from and independently of the rest of the article and, if so construed, its language is wide enough to cover in fringements of rights of property by private individuals."
REASONING,"He laid emphasis on the omission of the word ""State"" in clause (1) while it was used in clause (2) of the same article as well as in many other articles in Part III."
REASONING,"Referring to entry No. 33 of the Union List, entry No. 36 of the State List and entry No, 42 of the Concurrent List of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution, he also argued that, while these entries read with article 246 empowered Parliament and the State Legislatures to make laws regarding acquisition or requisitioning of property for the purposes of the Union or the State as the case may be."
REASONING,"no power was conferred to make laws regarding ""deprivation of property"" by the State, so that the ""deprivation"" contemplated in clause (1) could only be deprivation by individuals."
REASONING,"Sub section (1) of section 299 of the Government of India Act, 1935, corresponding to clause (1) of article a 1 was, it was pointed out, omitted in the draft article 19 (later numbered as article 81) which retained in a modified form only the provision contained in sub section (2) of that section relating to compulsory acquisition of property for public purposes."
REASONING,"But, clause (1) was subsequently restored and article was enacted in its present form as recommended in Drafting Committee 's Report and this, it was claimed, showed that clause (1) was intended to operate as a distinct provi sion apart from clause (2)."
REASONING,We see no force in any of these arguments.
REASONING,"In support of the argument that clause (1 ) should be construed in isolation from the rest of the article, the petitioner relied on certain observations of our learned brother Das in Chiranjit Lal vs The Union of India (1), where the view was expressed that clause (1)enunciated the general principle that no person should be deprived (1) [1950] S.C,R,. 860."
REASONING,"394 of his property except by authority of law and laid down no condition for payment of compensation, while clause (2) dealt with deprivation of property brought about by acquisi tion or taking possession of it and required payment of compensation."
REASONING,"In other words, deprivation referred to in clause(1) must be taken to cover deprivation otherwise than by acquisition or requisitioning of property dealt with in clause (2)."
REASONING,We consider it unnecessary for the purpose of the present petition to go into that question.
REASONING,"Even assuming that clause (1) has to be read and construed apart from clause (2), it is clear that it is a declaration of the fundamental right of private property in the same negative form in which article 21 declares the fundamental right to life and liberty."
REASONING,There is no express reference to the State in article 21.
REASONING,"But could it be suggested on that account that that article was intended to afford protection to life and personal liberty against violation by private individuals ? The words ""except by procedure established by law"" plainly exclude such a suggestion."
REASONING,"Similarly, the words ""save by authority of law"" in clause (1) of article 31 show that it is a prohibition of unauthorised governmental action against private property, as there can be no question of one private individual being authorised by law to deprive anoth er of his property."
REASONING,The argument based on the entries in the Lists is fallacious.
REASONING,"It is not correct to suggest that, merely be cause there is no entry in the Lists of the Seventh Schedule relating to ""deprivation of property"" as such, it is not within the competence of the legislatures in the country to enact a law authorising deprivation of property."
REASONING,"Such a law could be made, for instance, under entry No. 1 of List II, entry No. 1 of List II or entry No. 1 of List III."
REASONING,"Article 31 (1) itself contemplates a law being passed authorising deprivation of the properties, and it is futile to deny the existence of the requisite legislative power."
REASONING,Nor does the legislative history of the article lend any support to the petitioner 's contention.
REASONING,"Section 299 395 (1) of the Government of India Act, 1935, was never inter preted as prohibiting deprivation of property by private individuals."
REASONING,"Its restoration, therefore, in the same form in article 31, after omission in the original draft article 19, could lead to no inference in support c. of the peti tioner 's contention, which indeed proceeds on the fundamen tal misconception that article 19(1)(f) and article 31 (1), which are great constitutional safeguards against State aggression on private property, are directed against in fringements by private individuals for which remedies should be sought in the ordinary law."
REASONING,In this view it is unnecessary to deal with certain other objections to the maintainability of the petition raised by the Solicitor General on behalf of the Bank.
RPC,The petition is dismissed.
RPC,We make no order as to costs.
RPC,Petition dismissed.

COUNSEL,"G.N. Joshi, for the petitioners."
COUNSEL,"S.M. Sikri, for the respondent."
JUDGE,The judgment 0 the Court was delivered by MAHAJAN J.
FACTS,These two applications for enforcement of the fundamental right guaranteed under article 19 (1) (g) of the Constitution of India have been made by a proprietor and an employee respectively of a bidi manufacturing concern of District Sagar (State of Madhya Pradesh).
FACTS,It is contended that the law in force in the State authorizing it to prohib it the manufacture of bidis in certain villages including the one 761 wherein the applicants reside is inconsistent with the provisions of Part III of the Constitution and is conse quently void.
FACTS,"The Central Provinces and Berar Regulation of Manufac ture of Bidis (Agricultural Purposes) Act, LXIV of 1948, was passed on 19th October 1948 and was the law in force in the State at the commencement of the Constitution."
STATUTE,"Sections 3 and 4 of the Act are in these terms; "" 3."
STATUTE,The Deputy Commissioner may by notification fix a period to be an agricultural season with respect to such villages as may be specified therein.
STATUTE,"(1) The Deputy Commissioner may, by general order which shall extend to such villages as he may specify, prohibit the manufacture of bidis during the agricultural season."
STATUTE,"(2) No person residing in a village specified in such order shall during the agricultural season engage himself in the manufacture of bidis, and no manufacturer shall during the said season employ any person for the manufacture of bidis."
FACTS,""" On the 13th June 1950 an order was issued by the Deputy Commissioner of Sagar under the provisions of the Act for bidding all persons residing in certain villages from engag ing in the manufacture of bidis."
FACTS,On the 19th June 1950 these two petitions were presented to this Court under article 32 of the Constitution challenging the validity of the order as it prejudicially affected the petitioners ' right of freedom of occupation and business.
FACTS,During the pendency of the petitions the season mentioned in the order of the 13th June ran out.
FACTS,A fresh order for the ensuing agricultural season 8th October to 18th November 1950 was issued on 29th September 1950 in the same terms.
FACTS,This order was also challenged in a supplementary petition.
STATUTE,"Article 19 (1) (g) runs as follows : ""All citizens shall have the right to practise any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or busi ness."
STATUTE,""" 762 The article guarantees freedom of occupation and busi ness."
STATUTE,"The freedom guaranteed herein is, however, subject to the limitations imposed by clause (6) of article 19."
STATUTE,"That clause is in these terms : ""Nothing in sub clause (g) of the said clause shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it imposes, or prevent the State from making any law imposing, in the interests of the general public, reasonable restric tions on the exercise of the right conferred by the said sub clause, and, in particular, nothing in the said sub clause shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it prescribes or empowers any authority to prescribe, or prevent the State from making any law prescribing or empowering any authority to prescribe, the professional or technical qualifications necessary for practising any pro fession or carrying on any occupation, trade or business."
STATUTE,""" The point for consideration in these applications is whether the Central Provinces and Berar Act LXIV of 1948 comes within the ambit of this saving clause or is in excess of its provisions."
ARG,The learned counsel for the petitioners contends that the impugned Act does not impose reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the fundamental right in the interests of the general public but totally negatives it.
STATUTE,"In the preamble to the Act, it is stated that it has been enacted to provide measures for the supply of adequate labour for agricultural purposes in bidi manufacturing areas."
STATUTE,Sections 3 and 4 cited above empower the Deputy Commissioner to prohibit the manufacture of bidis during the agricultural season.
STATUTE,"The contravention of any of these provisions is made punishable by section 7 of the Act, the penalty being imprisonment for a term which may extend to six months or with fine or with both."
REASONING,It was enacted to help in the grow more food campaign and for the purpose of bring ing under the plough considerable areas of fallow land.
REASONING,"The phrase ""reasonable restriction"" connotes that the limitation imposed on a person in enjoyment of the right should not be arbitrary or of an excessive nature, beyond what is required in the interests of the public."
REASONING,"The word ""reasonable"" implies intelligent care and deliberation, that is, the choice of a course which reason dictates."
REASONING,"Legisla tion which arbitrarily or excessively invades the right cannot be said to contain the quality of reasonableness and unless it strikes a proper balance between the freedom guaranteed in article 19 (1) (g) and the social control permitted by clause (6) of article 19, it must be held to be wanting in that quality."
REASONING,Clause (6) in the concluding paragraph particularizes certain instances of the nature of the restrictions that were in the mind of the constitution makers and which have the quality of reasonableness.
REASONING,They afford a guide to the interpretation of the clause and illustrate the extent and nature of the restrictions which according to the statute could be imposed on the freedom guaranteed in clause (g).
REASONING,The statute in substance and effect suspends altogether the right mentioned in article 19 (1) (g) during the agri cultural seasons and such suspension may lead to such dislocation of the industry as to prove its ultimate ruin.
REASONING,The object of the statute is to provide measures for the supply of adequate labour for agricultural purposes in bidi manufacturing areas of the Province and it could well be achieved by legislation restraining the employment of agri cultural labour in the manufacture 764 of bidis during the agricultural season.
REASONING,Even in point of time a restriction may well have been reasonable if it amounted to a regulation of the hours of work in the busi ness.
REASONING,"Such legislation though it would limit the field for recruiting persons for the manufacture of bidis and regulate the hours of the working of the industry, would not have amounted to a complete stoppage of the business of manufac ture and might well have been within the ambit of clause (6)."
REASONING,"The effect of the provisions of the Act, however, has no reasonable relation to the object in view but is so drastic in scope that it goes much in excess of that object."
REASONING,"Not only are the provisions of the statute in excess of the requirements of the case but the language employed prohibits a manufacturer of bidis from employing any person m his business, no matter wherever that person may be residing."
REASONING,"In other words, a manufacturer of bidis residing in this area cannot import labour from neighbouring places in the district or province or from outside the province."
REASONING,Such a prohibition on the face of it is of an arbitrary nature inasmuch as it has no relation whatsoever to the object which the legislation seeks to achieve and as such cannot be said to be a reasonable restriction on the exercise of the right.
REASONING,Further the statute seeks to prohibit all persons residing in the notified villages during the agricultural season from engaging themselves in the manufacture of bidis.
REASONING,"It cannot be denied that there would be a number of infirm and disabled persons, a number of children, old women and petty shop keepers residing in these villages who are inca pable of being used for agricultural labour."
REASONING,All such persons are prohibited by law from engaging themselves in the manufacture of bidis; and are thus being deprived of earning their livelihood.
REASONING,It is a matter of common knowledge that there are certain classes of persons residing in every village who do not engage in agricultural operations.
REASONING,They and their womenfolk and children in their leisure hours supplement their income by engaging themselves in bidi business.
REASONING,"There seems no reason for prohibiting them from carrying on this occupation, The statute as 765 it stands, not only compels those who can be engaged in agricultural work from not taking to other avocations, but it also prohibits persons who have no connection or relation to agricultural operations from engaging in the business of bidi making and thus earning their livelihood."
REASONING,"These provi sions of the statute, in our opinion, cannot be said to amount to reasonable restrictions on the right of the appli cants and that being so, the statute is not in conformity with the provisions of Part III of the Constitution."
REASONING,The law even to the extent that it could be said to authorize the imposition of restrictions in regard to agricultural labour cannot be held valid because the language employed is wide enough to cover restrictions both within and without the limits of constitutionally permissible legislative action affecting the right.
REASONING,"So long as the possibility of its being applied for purposes not sanctioned by the Consti tution cannot be ruled out, it must be held to be wholly void."
REASONING,"Mr. Sikri for the Government of Madhya Pradesh contends that the legislature of Madhya Pradesh was the proper judge of the reasonableness of the restrictions imposed by the statute, that that legislature alone knew the conditions prevailing in the State and it alone could say what kind of legislation could effectively achieve the end in view and would help in the grow more food campaign and would help for bringing in fallow land under the plough and that this Court sitting at this great distance could not judge by its own yardstick of reason whether the restrictions imposed in the circumstances of the case were reasonable or not."
REASONING,This argument runs counter to the clear provisions of the Con stitution.
REASONING,The determination by the legislature of what constitutes a reasonable restriction is not final or conclu sive;it is subject to the supervision by this Court.
REASONING,"In the matter of fundamental rights, the Supreme Court watches and guards the rights guaranteed by the Constitution and in exercising its functions it has the power to set aside an Act of the Legislature if it is in violation of the freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution."
RPC,We are therefore of opinion 98 766 that the impugned statute does not stand the test of reason ableness and is therefore void.
RPC,"The result therefore is that the orders issued by the Deputy Commissioner on 13th June 1950 and 26th September 1950 are void, inoperative and ineffective."
RPC,We therefore direct the respondents not to enforce the provisions con tained in section 4 of the Act against the petitioners in any manner whatsoever.
RPC,The petitioners will have their costs of these proceedings in the two petitions.
RPC,Petitions allowed.

JUDGE,Fazl Ali J. delivered Judgment as follows.
JUDGE,"Patanjali Sastri C.J., Mahajan, Mukherjea, Das and Chandrasekhara Aiyar JJ."
FACTS,This is an appeal from an order of the Madras High Court dismissing the petition of the appellant praying for a writ of certiorari.
FACTS,The appellant was one of the persons who had filed nomination papers for election to the Madras Legislative Assembly from the Namakkal Constituency in Salem district.
FACTS,"On the 28th November, 1951, the Returning Officer for that constituency took up for scrutiny the nomination papers filed by the various candidates and on the same day he rejected the appellant 's nomination paper on certain grounds which need not be set out as they are not material to the point raised in this appeal."
FACTS,The appellant thereupon moved the High Court under article 226 of the Constitution praying for a writ of of certiorari to quash the order of the Re turning Officer rejecting his nomination paper and to direct the Returning Officer to include his name in the list of valid nominations to be published.
FACTS,The High Court dismissed the appellant 's application on the ground that it had no jurisdiction to interfere with the order of the Returning Officer by reason of the provisions of article 329(b) of the Constitution.
FACTS,"The appellant 's contention in this appeal is that the view expressed by the High Court is not correct, that the jurisdiction of the High Court is not affected by article 329 (b) of the Constitution and that he was enti tled to a writ of certiorari in the circumstances of the case."
FACTS,"Broadly speaking, the arguments on which the judgment of the High Court is assailed are two fold : (1) that the conclusion arrived at by the High Court does not follow from the language of article 329 (b) of the Constitution, whether that article is read by itself or along with the other articles in Part XV of the Constitu tion; and (2) that the anomalies which will arise if the construc tion put by the High Court on article 329 (b) is accepted, are so startling that the courts should lean in favour of the construction put forward on behalf of the appellant."
FACTS,"29 222 The first argument which turns on the construction of article 329 (b) requires serious consideration, but I think the second argument can be disposed of briefly at the out set."
FACTS,"It should be stated that what the appellant chooses to call anomaly can be more appropriately described as hardship or prejudice and what their nature will be has been stated in forceful language by Wallace J. in Sarvothama Rao vs Chairman, Municipal Council, Saidapet (1) in these words : ""I am quite clear that any post election remedy is wholly inadequate to afford the relief which the petitioner seeks, namely, that this election, now published be stayed, until it can be held with himself as a candidate."
FACTS,It is no conso lation to tell him that he can stand for some other elec tion.
FACTS,It is no remedy to tell him that he must let the election go on and then have it set aside by petition and have a fresh election ordered.
FACTS,The fresh election may be under altogether different conditions and may bring forward an array of fresh candidates.
FACTS,"The petitioner can only have his proper relief if the proposed election without him is stayed until his rejected nomination is restored, and hence an injunction staying this election was absolutely neces sary, unless the relief asked for was to be denied him altogether in limine."
FACTS,"In most cases of this kind no doubt there will be difficulty for the aggrieved party to get in his suit in time before the threatened wrong is committed; but when he has succeeded in so doing, the Court cannot stultify itself by allowing the wrong which it is asked to prevent to be actually consummated while it is engaged in trying the suit."
PRECEDENT,""" These observations however represent only one side of the picture and the same learned Judge presented the other side of the picture in a subsequent case [Desi Chettiar vs Chinnasami Chettiar(2)] in the following passage : ""The petitioner is not without his remedy."
PRECEDENT,His remedy lies in an election petition which we understand he has already put in.
PRECEDENT,It is argued for him (1) mad. 585 at 600.
REASONING,"In the first place, we do not see how the mere fact that the petitioner cannot get the election stopped and has his remedy only after it is over by an election petition, will in itself confer on him any right to obtain a writ."
REASONING,"In the second place, these observations were directed to the consideration of the propriety of an injunction in a civil suit, a matter with which we are not here concerned."
REASONING,And finally it may.
REASONING,be observed that these remarks were made some years ago when the practice of individuals coming forward to stop elections in order that their own individual interest may be safe guarded was not so common.
REASONING,"It is clear that there is anoth er side of the question to be considered, namely, the incon venience to the public administration of having elections and the business of Local Boards held up while individuals prosecute their individual grievances."
REASONING,"We understand the election for the elective seats in this Union has been held up since 31st May because of this petition, the result being that the electors have been unable since then to have any representation on the Board, and the Board is functioning, if indeed it is functioning, with a mere nominated fraction of its total strength; and this state of affairs the peti tioner proposes to have continued until his own personal grievance is satisfied."" These observations which were made in regard to elec tions to Local Boards will apply with greater force to elections to legislatures, because it does not require much argument to show that in a country with a democratic consti tution in which the legislatures have to play a very impor tant role, it will lead to serious consequences, if the elections are unduly proracted or obstructed."
REASONING,To this aspect of the matter I shall have to advert later.
REASONING,"but it is suffi cient for the present purpose (1) Mad, 585 at 600."
REASONING,"224 to state firstly that in England the hardship and inconven ience which may be suffered by an individual candidate has not been regarded as of sufficient weight to induce Parlia ment to make provision for immediate relief and the ag grieved candidate has to wait until after the election to challenge the validity of the rejection of his nomina tion paper, and secondly, that the question of hardship or inconvenience is after all only a secondary question, be cause if the construction put by the High Court on article 329 (b) of the Constitution is found to be correct, the fact that such construction will lead to hardship and inconven ience becomes irrelevant."
REASONING,"Article 329 is the last article in Part XV of the Constitution, the heading of which is ""Elections"", and it runs as follows : ""Notwithstanding anything in this Constitution (a) the validity of any law relating to the delimitation of constituencies or the allotment of seats to such constit uencies, made or purporting to be made under article 327 or article 328, shall not be called in question in any court; (b) no election to either House of Parliament or to the House or either House of the Legislature of a State shall be called in question except by an election petition presented to such authority and in such manner as may be provided for, by, or under any law made by the appropriate Legislature."
REASONING,""" In construing this article, reference was made by both parties in the course of their arguments to the other arti cles in the same Part, namely, articles 324, 325, 326, 327 and 328."
REASONING,"Article 324 provides for the constitution and appointment of an Election Commissioner to superintend, direct and control ejections to the legislatures; article 325 prohibits discrimination against electors on the ground of religion, race, caste or sex; article 326 provides for adult suffrage; article 327 empowers Parliament to pass laws making provision with respect to all matters relating to, or in connection with, elections to the legislatures, subject 225 to the provisions of the Constitution; and article 328 is a complementary article giving power to the State Legislature to make provision with respect to all matters relating to, or in connection with, elections to the State Legislature."
REASONING,"A notable difference in the language used in articles 327 and 328 on the one hand, and article 329 on the other, is that while the first ' two articles begin with the words"" subject to the provisions of this Constitution"" the last article begins with the words ""notwithstanding anything in this Constitution."
REASONING,""" It was conceded at the bar that the effect of this difference in language is that whereas any law made by Parliament under article 327, or by the State Legislatures under article 328, cannot exclude the jurisdic tion of the High Court under article 226 of the Constitu tion, that jurisdiction is excluded in regard to matters provided for in article 329."
REASONING,"Now, the main controversy in this appeal centres round the meaning of the words ""no election shall be called in question except by an election petition"" in article 329 (b), and the point to be decided is whether questioning the action of the Returning Officer in rejecting a nomination paper can be said to be comprehended within the words, ""no election shall be called in question."
ARG,""" The appellant 's case is that questioning something which has happened before a candidate is declared elected is not the same thing as questioning an election, and the arguments advanced on his behalf in support of this construction were these: (1) That the word ""election"" as used in article 329 (b) means what it normally and etymologically means, namely, the result of polling or the final selection of a candidate; (2) That the fact that an election petition can be filed only after polling is over or after a candidate is declared elected, and what is normally called in question by such petition is the final result, bears out the conten tion that the word ""election ""can have no other meaning in article (b) than the result of polling or the final selec tion of a candidate; 226 (3) That the words ""arising out of or in connection with"" which are used in article 324 (1) and the words ""with respect to all matters relating to, or in connection with"" which are used in articles 327 and s28, show that the fram ers of the Constitution knew that it was necessary to use different language when referring respectively to matters which happen prior to and after the result of polling, and if they had intended to include the rejection of a nomina tion paper within the ambit of the prohibition contained in article S29 (b) they would have used similar language in that article and (4) That the action of the Returning Officer in reject ing a nomination paper can be questioned before the High Court under article 226 of the Constitution for the follow ing reason: Scrutiny of nomination papers and their rejec tion are provided for in section 36 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951."
ARG,"Parliament has made this provision in exercise of the powers conferred on it by article 327 of the Constitution which is ""subject to the provisions of the Constitution""."
ARG,"Therefore, the action of the Returning Offi cer is subject to the extraordinary jurisdiction of the High Court under article 226."
ARG,"These arguments appear at first sight to be quite im pressive, but in my opinion there are weightier and basical ly more important arguments in support of the view taken by the High Court."
REASONING,"As we have seen, the most important ques tion for determination is the meaning to be given to the word ""election"" in article 329 (b)."
REASONING,"That word has by long usage in connection with the process of selection of proper representatives in democratic institutions, acquired both a wide and a narrow meaning."
REASONING,"In the narrow sense, it is used to mean the final selection of a candidate which may em brace the result of the poll when there is polling or a particular candidate being returned unopposed when there is no poll."
REASONING,"In the wide sense, the word is used to connote the entire process culminating in a candidate being declared 227 elected."
REASONING,"In Srinivasalu vs Kuppuswami(1), the learned Judges of the Madras High Court after examining the question, expressed the opinion that the term ""election"" may be taken to embrace the whole procedure whereby an ""elected member"" is returned, whether or not it be found necessary to take a poll."
REASONING,"With this view, my brother, Maimjan J. expressed his agreement in Sat Narain vs Hanuman Prasad (2); and I also find myself in agreement with it."
REASONING,"It seems to me that the word ""election"" has been used in Part XV of the Constitution in the wide sense, that is to say, to connote the entire procedure to be gone through to return a candidate to the legislature."
REASONING,"The use of the expression ""conduct of elections"" in article 324 specifically points to the wide meaning, and that meaning can also be read consistently into the other provisions which occur in Part XV including article 329 (b)."
REASONING,"That the word ""election"" bears this wide meaning whenever we talk of elections in a democratic country, is borne out by the fact that in most of the books on the subject and in several cases dealing with the matter, one of the questions mooted is, when the election begins."
REASONING,"The subject is dealt with quite concisely in Halsbury 's Laws of England in the following passage(s) under the heading"" Commencement of the Election "": ""Although the first formal step in every election is the issue of the writ, the election is considered for some purposes to begin at an earlier date."
REASONING,"It is a question of fact in each case when an election begins in such a way as to make the parties concerned responsible for breaches of election law, the test being whether the contest is ""reason ably imminent""."
REASONING,Neither the issue of the writ nor the publi cation of the notice of election can be looked to as fixing the date when an election begins from this point of view.
REASONING,"Nor, again, does the nomination day afford any criterion."
REASONING,The election will usually begin at least earlier than the issue of the writ.
REASONING,The question when the election begins must be care (1) at 255.
REASONING,"(2) (3) See page 237 of Halsbury 's Laws of England, 2nd edition, Volume 12."
REASONING,"228 fully distinguished from that as to when ""the conduct and management of"" an election may be said to begin."
REASONING,"Again, the question as to when a particular person commences to be a candidate is a question to be considered in each case."
REASONING,""" The discussion in this passage makes it clear that the word ' 'election"" can be and has been appropriately used with reference to the entire process which consists of several stages and embraces many steps, some of which may have an important bearing on the result of the process."
REASONING,"The next important question to be considered is what is meant by the words ""no election shall be called in ques tion""."
REASONING,"A reference to any treatise on elections in England will show that an election proceeding in that country is liable to be assailed on very limited grounds, one of them being the improper rejection of a nomination paper."
REASONING,"The law with which we are concerned is not materially different, and we find that in section 100 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, one of the grounds for declaring an elec tion to be void is the improper rejection of a nomination paper."
REASONING,"The question now arises whether the law of elections in this country contemplates that there should be two attacks on matters connected with election proceedings, one while they are going on by invoking the extraordinary jurisdiction of the High Court under article 226 of the Constitution (the ordinary jurisdiction of the courts having been expressly excluded), and another after they have been completed by means of an election petition."
REASONING,"In my opinion, to affirm such a position would be contrary to the scheme of Part XV of the Constitution and the Representation of the People Act, which, as I shall point out later, seems to be that any matter which has the effect of vitiating an election should be brought up only at the appropriate stage in an appropri ate manner before a special tribunal and should not be brought up at an intermediate stage before any court."
REASONING,"It seems to me that under the election law, the only signifi cance which the rejection of 229 a nomination paper has consists in the fact that it can be used as a ground to call the election in question."
REASONING,"Arti cle 329(b)was apparently enacted to prescribe the manner in which and the stage at which this ground, and other grounds which may be raised under the law to call the election in question could be urged."
REASONING,"I think it follows by necessary implication from the language of this provision that those grounds cannot be urged in any other manner, at any other stage and before any other court."
REASONING,"If the grounds on which an election can be called in question could be raised at an earlier stage and errors, if any, are rectified, there will be no meaning in enacting a provision like article 329 (b) and in setting up a special tribunal."
REASONING,"Any other meaning ascribed to the words used in the article would lead to anomalies, which the Constitution could not have contemplat ed, one of them being that conflicting views may be ex pressed by the High Court at the pre polling stage and by the election tribunal, which is to be an independent body, at the stage when the matter is brought up before it."
REASONING,"I think that a brief examination of the scheme of Part XV of the Constitution and the Representation of the People Act, 1951, will show that the construction I have suggested is the correct one."
REASONING,"Broadly speaking, before an election machinery can be brought into operation, there are three requisites which require to be attended to, namely, (1) there should be a set of laws and rules making provisions with respect to all matters relating to, or in connection with, elections, and it should be decided as to how these laws and rules are to be made;(2) there should be an execu tive charged with the duty of securing the due conduct of elections; and (3)there should be a judicial tribunal to deal with disputes arising out of or in connection with elections."
REASONING,"Articles 327 and 328 deal with the first of these requisites, article 324 with the second and article 329 with the third requisite."
REASONING,"The other two articles in Part XV, viz, articles 325 and 326, deal with two matters of princi ple to which the Constitution framers have attached much importance."
REASONING,"They 30 230 are : (1) prohibition against discrimination in the prepa ration of, or eligibility for inclusion in, the electoral rolls, on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or any of them; and (2) adult suffrage."
REASONING,Part XV of the Constitution is really a code in itself providing the entire ground work for enacting appropriate laws and setting up suitable ma chinery for the conduct of elections.
REASONING,"The Representation of the People Act, 1951, which was passed by Parliament under article 327 of the Constitution."
REASONING,makes detailed provisions in regard to all matters and all stages connected with elections to the various legislatures in this country.
REASONING,"That Act is divided into II parts, and it is interesting to see the wide variety of subjects they deal with."
REASONING,"Part Il deals with ""the qualifications and disquali fications for membership"", Part III deals with the notifica tion of General Elections, Part IV provides for the adminis trative machinery for the conduct of elections, and Part V makes provisions for the actual conduct of elections and deals with such matters as presentation of nomination pa pers."
REASONING,"requirements of a valid nomination, scrutiny of nomi nations, etc., and procedure for polling and counting of votes."
REASONING,"Part VI deals with disputes regarding elections and provides for the manner of presentation of election peti tions, the constitution of election tribunals and the trial of election petitions."
REASONING,"Part VII outlines the various cor rupt and illegal practices which may affect the elections, and electoral offences."
REASONING,"Obviously, the Act is a self contained enactment so far as elections are concerned, which means that whenever we have to ascertain the true position in regard to any matter connected with elections, we have only to look at the Act and the rules made thereunder."
REASONING,"The provisions of the Act which are material to the present discussion are sections 80, 100, 105 and 170, and the provi sions of Chapter II of Part IV dealing with the form of election petitions, their contents and the reliefs which may be sought in them."
REASONING,"Section 80, which is drafted in almost the same language as article 329 (b), provides that ""no election shall be called in question except by an election 231 petition presented in accordance with the provisions of this Part""."
REASONING,"Section 100, as we have already seen, provides for the grounds on which an election may be called in question, one of which is the improper rejection of a nomination paper."
REASONING,"Section 105 says that ""every order of the Tribunal made under this Act shall be final and conclusive""."
REASONING,"Section 170 provides that ""no civil court shall have jurisdiction to question the legality of any action taken or of any decision given by the Returning Officer or by any other person appointed under this Act in connection with an elec tion."
REASONING,""" These are the main provisions regarding election matters being judicially dealt with, and it should be noted that there is no provision anywhere to the effect that anything connected with elections can be questioned at an intermediate stage."
REASONING,"It is now well recognized that where a right or liability is created by a statute which gives a special remedy for en forcing it, the remedy provided by that statute only must be availed of."
REASONING,"This rule was stated with great clarity by Willes J. in Wolverhampton New Water Works Co. vs Hawkes ford(1) in the following passage : ""There are three classes of cases in which a liability may be established founded upon statute."
REASONING,"One is, where there was a liability existing at common law and that li ability is affirmed by a statute which gives a special and peculiar form of remedy different from the remedy which existed at common law;there, unless the statute contains words which expressly or by necessary implication exclude the common law remedy, the party suing has his election to pursue either that or the statutory remedy."
REASONING,"The second class of cases is, where the statute gives the right to suemerely, but provides no particular form of remedy: there, the party can only proceed by action at common law."
REASONING,"But there is a third class, viz., where a liability not existing at common law is created by a statute which at the same time gives a special and particular remedy for enforcing it. ."
REASONING,"The remedy provided by the statute must be followed, and it is not (1) ; , 356."
REASONING,232 competent to the party to pursue the course applicable to cases of the second class.
REASONING,The form given by the statute must be adopted and adhered to.
REASONING,""" The rule laid down in this passage was approved by the House of Lords in Neville vs London Express Newspaper Limit ed(1) and has been reaffirmed by the Privy Council in Attorney General of Trinidad and Tobago vs Gordon Grant & Co.(2) and Secretary of State vs Mask & Co.(a); and it has also been held to be equally applicable to enforcement of rights: see Hurdutrai vs Official Assignee of Calcutta(4)."
REASONING,"That being so, I think it will be a fair inference from the provisions of the Representation of the People Act to state that the Act provides for only one remedy, that remedy being by an election petition to be presented after the election is over, and there is no remedy provided at any intermediate stage."
ARG,"It was argued that since the Representation of the People Act was enacted subject to the provisions of the Constitution, it cannot bar the jurisdiction of the High Court to issue writs under article 226 of the Constitution."
ARG,This argument however is completely shut out by reading the Act along with article 329 (b).
REASONING,"It will be noticed that the language used in that article and in section 80 of the Act is almost identical, with this difference only that the article is preceded by the words ""notwithstanding anything in this Constitution""."
REASONING,I think that those words are quite apt to exclude the jurisdiction of the High Court to deal with any matter which may arise while the elections are in progress.
REASONING,"It may be stated that section 107(1) of the Representation of People Act, 1949 (12 & 13 Geo."
REASONING,"6, c. 68) in England is drafted almost in the same language as article 329(b)."
REASONING,"That section runs thus : ""No parliamentary election and no return to Parliament shall be questioned except by a petition complaining of an undue election or undue return (hereinafter referred to as a parliamentary election petition) presented in accordance with this Part of this Act."
REASONING,""" (1) (3) (2) [1935] A.C. 532."
REASONING,"(4) , 349."
REASONING,"233 It appears that similar language was used in the earlier statutes, and it is noteworthy that it has never been held in England that the improper rejection of a nomination paper can be the subject of a writ of certiorari or mandamus."
REASONING,"On the other hand, it was conceded at the bar that the ques tion of improper rejection of a nomination paper has always been brought up in that country before the appropriate tribunal by means of an election petition after the conclu sion of the election."
REASONING,"It is true that there is no direct decision holding that the words used in the relevant provi sions exclude the jurisdiction of the High Court to issue appropriate prerogative writs at an intermediate stage of the election, but the total absence of any such decision can be accounted for only on the view that the provisions in question have been generally understood to have that effect."
REASONING,"Our attention was drawn to rule 13 of the rules appended to the Ballot Act of 1872 and a similar rule in the Parliamen tary Elections Rules of 1949, providing that the decision of the Returning Officer disallowing an objection to a nomina tion paper shall be final, but allowing the same shall be subject to reversal on a petition questioning the election or return."
REASONING,These rules however do not affect the main argument.
REASONING,"I think it can be legitimately stated that if words similar to those used in article 329 (b) have been consistently treated in England as words apt to exclude the jurisdiction of the courts including the High Court, the same consequence must follow from the words used in article 329 (b) of the Constitution."
REASONING,"The words ""notwithstanding anything in this Constitution"" give to that article the same wide and binding effect as a statute passed by a sover eign legislature like the English Parliament."
REASONING,It may be pointed out that article 329 (b) must be read as complimentary to clause (a) of that article.
REASONING,Clause (a) bars the jurisdiction of the courts with regard to such law as may be made under articles 327 and 328 relating to the delimitation of constituencies or the allotment of seats to such constituencies.
REASONING,It was conceded before us that article 329 (b) ousts the jurisdiction of the courts with regard to matters 234 arising between the commencement of the polling and the final selection.
REASONING,The question which has to be asked is what conceivable reason the legislature could have had to leave only matters connected with nominations subject to the jurisdiction of the High Court under article 226 of the Constitution.
REASONING,"If Part XV of the Constitution is a code by itself, i. e., it creates rights and provides for their enforcement by a special tribunal to the exclusion of all courts including the High Court, there can be no reason for assuming that the Constitution left one small part of the election process to be made the subject matter of contest before the High Courts and thereby upset the time schedule of the elections The more reasonable view seems to be that article 329 covers all ""electoral matters""."
REASONING,"The conclusions which I have arrived at may be summed up briefly as follows : (1) Having regard to the important functions which the legislatures have to perform in democratic countries, it has always been recognized to be a matter of first importance that elections should be concluded as early as possible according to time schedule and all controversial matters and all disputes arising out of elections should be postponed till after the elections are over, so that the election proceedings may not be unduly retarded or protracted."
REASONING,"(2) In conformity with this principle, the scheme the elec tion law in this country as well as in England is that no significance should be attached to anything which does not affect the ""election""; and if any irregularities are commit ted while it is in progress and they belong to the category or class which, under the law by which elections are gov erned, would have the effect of vitiating the ' 'election"" and enable the person affected to call it in question, they should be brought up before a special tribunal by means of an election petition and not be made the subject of a dis pute before any court while the election is in progress."
REASONING,It will be useful at this stage to refer to the deci sion the Privy Council in Theberge vs Laudry(1).
REASONING,"The (1) 235 petitioner in that case having been declared duly elected a member to represent an electoral district in the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Quebec, his election was after wards, on petition, declared null and void by judgment of the Superior Court, under the Quebec Controverted Elections Act, 1875, and himself declared guilty of corrupt practices both personally and by his agents."
REASONING,"Thereupon, he applied for special leave to appeal to Her Majesty in Council, but it was refused on the ground that the fair construction of the Act of 1875 and the Act of 1872 which preceded it providing among other things that the judgment of the Superior Court ""shall not be susceptible of appeal"" was that it was the intention of the legislature to create a tribunal for the purpose of trying election petitions in a manner which should make its decision final for all purposes, and should not annex to it the incident of its judgment being reviewed by the Crown under its prerogative."
REASONING,"In delivering the judgment of the Privy Council, Lord Cairns observed as follows : ""These two Acts of Parliament, the Acts of 1872 and 1875, are Acts peculiar in their character."
REASONING,"They are not Acts constituting or providing for the decision of mere ordinary civil rights; they are Acts creating an entirely new, and up to that time unknown, jurisdiction in a partic ular Court. for the purpose of taking out, with its own consent, of the Legislative Assembly, and vesting in that Court, that very peculiar jurisdiction which, up to that time, had existed in the Legislative Assembly of decid ing election petitions, and determining the: status of those who claimed to be members of the Legislative Assembly."
REASONING,"A jurisdiction of that kind is extremely special, and one of the obvious incidents or consequences of such a jurisdiction must be that the jurisdiction, by whomsoever it is to be exercised, should be exercised in a way that should as soon as possible become conclusive; and enable the constitution of the Legislative Assembly to be distinctly and speedily known."
REASONING,""" 236 After dealing with certain other matters, the Lord ChanCellor proceeded to make the following further observa tions : ""Now, the subject matter, as has been said, of the legislation is extremely peculiar."
REASONING,It concerns the rights and privileges of the electors and of the Legislative Assem bly to which they elect members.
REASONING,"Those rights and privi leges have always in every colony, following the example of the mother country, been jealously maintained and guarded by the Legislative Assembly."
REASONING,"Above all, they have been looked upon as rights and privileges which pertain to the Legisla tive Assembly, in complete independence of the Crown, so far as they properly exist."
REASONING,"And it would be a result somewhat surprising, and hardly in consonance with the general scheme of the legislation, if, with regard to rights and privileges of this kind, it were to be found that in the last resort the determination of them no longer belonged to the Legis lative Assembly, no longer belonged to the Superior Court which the Legislative Assembly had put in its place, but belonged to the Crown in Council, with the advice of the advisers of the Crown at home, to be determined without reference either to the judgment of the Legislative Assem bly, or of that Court which the Legislative Assembly had substituted in its place."
REASONING,""" The points which emerge from this decision may be stated as follows : (1) The right to vote or stand as a candidate for elec tion is not a civil right but is a creature of statute or special law and must be subject to the limitations emposed by it."
REASONING,"(2) Strictly speaking, it is the sole right of the Legislature to examine and determine all matters relating to the election of its own members, and if the legislature takes it out of its own hands and vests in a special tribu nal an entirely new and unknown jurisdiction, that special jurisdiction should be exercised in accordance with the law which creates it."
REASONING,"237 It should be mentioned here that the question as to what the powers of the High Court under articles 226 and 227 and of this Court under article 136 of the Constitution may be, is one that will have to be decided on a proper occasion."
REASONING,It is necessary to refer at this stage to an argument advanced before us on behalf of the appellant which was based on the language of article 71 (1) of the Constitution.
REASONING,"That provision runs thus : ""All doubts and disputes arising out of or in connection with the election of a President or Vice President shall be inquired into and decided by the Supreme Court whose deci sion shall be final."
REASONING,""" The argument was as follows."
REASONING,There is a marked contrast between the language used in article 71 (1) and that of article 329 (b).
REASONING,The difference in the phraseology employed in the two provisions suggests that they could not have been intended to have the same meaning and scope as regards matters to be brought up before the tribunals they respec tively deal with.
REASONING,"If the framers of the Constitution, who apparently knew how to express themselves, intended to include within the ambit of article 329 (b) all possible disputes connected with elections to legislatures, includ ing disputes as to nominations, they would have used similar words as are to be found in article 71 (1)."
REASONING,"It is true that it is not necessary to use identical language in every provision, but one can conceive of various alternative ways of expression which would convey more clearly and properly what article 329 (b) is said to convey."
REASONING,"It seems to me that once it is admitted that the same idea can be expressed in different ways and the same phrase ology need not be employed in every provision, the argument loses much of its force."
REASONING,"But, however that may be, I think there is a good explanation as to why article 329 (b) was drafted as it stands."
REASONING,A reference to the election rules made under the Govern ment of India Acts of 1919 and 1935 will show that the provisions in them on the subject were almost in the same language as article 329 (b).
REASONING,"The 21 238 corresponding rule made under the Government of India Act, 1919, was rule 31 of the electoral rules, and it runs as follows : ""No election shall be called in question, except by an election petition presented in accordance with the provi sions of this Part."
REASONING,""" It should be noted that this rule occurs in Part VII, the heading of which is ""The final decision of doubts and disputes as to the validity of an election""."
REASONING,"These words throw some light on the function which the election tribunal was to perform, and they are the very words which the learned counsel for the appellant argued, ought to have been used to make the meaning clear."
REASONING,"The same scheme was followed in the election rules framed under the Government of India Act, 1935, which are contained in ""The Government of India (Provincial Elections) (Corrupt Practices and Election Petitions) Order, 1936"", dated the 3rd July, 1936."
REASONING,"In that Order, the rule corre sponding to rule 31 under the earlier Act, runs thus : ""No election shall be called in question except by an election petition presented in accordance with the provi sions of this Part of the Order."" This rule is to be found in Part III of the Order, the heading of which is ""Decision of doubts and disputes as to validity of an election and disqualification for corrupt practices."
REASONING,""" The rules to which I have referred were apparently framed on the pattern of the corresponding provisions of the British Acts of 1868 and 1872, and they must have been intended to cover the same ground as the provisions in England have been understood to cover in that country for so many years."
REASONING,"If the language used in article 329 (b) is considered against this historical background, it should not be difficult to see why the framers of the Constitution framed that provision in its present form and chose the language which had been consistently used in certain earlier legislative provisions and which had stood the test of time."
REASONING,239 And now a word as to why negative language was used in article 829 (b).
REASONING,It seems to me that there is an important difference between article 71 (1) and article 329 (b).
REASONING,"Article 71 (1) had to be in an affirmative form, because it confers special jurisdiction on the Supreme Court which that Court could not have exercised but for this article."
REASONING,"Arti cle 329 (b), on the other hand, was primarily intended to exclude or oust the jurisdiction of all courts in regard to electoral matters and to lay down the only mode in which an election could be challenged."
REASONING,"The negative form was there fore more appropriate, and, that being so, it is not sur prising that it was decided to follow the preexisting pat tern in which also the negative language had been adopted."
REASONING,"Before concluding, I should refer to an argument which was strenuously pressed by the learned counsel for the appellant and which has been reproduced by one of the learned Judges of the High Court in these words: ""It was next contended that if nomination is part election, a dis pute as to the validity of nomination is a dispute relating to election and that can be called in question only in accordance with the provisions of article 329 (b) by the presentation of an election petition to the appropriate Tribunal and that the Returning Officer would have no juris diction to decide that matter and it was further argued that section 36 of Act XLIII of 1981 would be ultra vires inasmuch as it confers on the Returning Officer a jurisdic tion which, article 329 (b) confers on a Tribunal to be appointed in accordance with the article."
REASONING,""" This argument displays great dialectical ingenuity, but it has no bearing on the result of this appeal and I think it can be very shortly answered."
REASONING,Under section 36 of the Representation.
REASONING,"of the People Act, 1951, it is the duty of the Returning Officer to scrutinize the nomination papers to ensure that they comply with the requirements of the Act and decide all objections which be made to any nomination."
REASONING,"It is clear that unless this duty is discharged properly, any number of candidates may stand for election without comply ing with the provisions of the Act and a great deal of 240 confusion may ensue."
REASONING,"In discharging the statutory duty imposed on him, the Returning Officer does not call in question any election."
REASONING,"Scrutiny of nomination papers is only a stage, though an important stage, in the election process."
REASONING,"It is one of the essential duties to be performed before the election can be completed, and anything done towards the completion of the election proceeding can by no stretch of reasoning be described as questioning the elec tion."
REASONING,The fallacy of the argument lies in treating a single step taken in furtherance of an election as equivalent to election.
REASONING,"The decision of this appeal however turns not on the construction of the single word ""election"", but on the construction of the compendious expression ""no election shall be called in question"" in its context and setting, with due regard to the scheme of Part XV of the Constitution and the Representation of the People Act, 1951."
REASONING,"Evidently, the argument has no bearing on this method of approach to the question posed in this appeal, which appears to me to be the only correct method."
REASONING,"We are informed that besides the Madras High Court, seven other State High Courts have held that they have no jurisdiction under article 226 of the Constitution to enter tain petitions regarding improper rejection of nomination papers."
REASONING,This view is in my opinion correct and must be affirmed.
RPC,The appeal must therefore fail and is dismissed.
RPC,"In view of the nature and importance of the points raised in this appeal, there should be no order to costs."

COUNSEL,"S.N. Mukherjee, for the appellant."
COUNSEL,"B. Sen, for the respondent."
JUDGE,The Judgment of the Court was deliv ered by FAZL ALI J.
FACTS,This is an appeal against the judgment of the High Court at Calcutta upholding the order of the Ses sions Judge of Midnapore convicting the appellant under section 326 of the Indian Penal Code and sentencing him to 3 years ' rigorous imprisonment.
FACTS,"The prosecution case against the appellant may be short ly stated as follows: The appellant and the injured person, Kurnad Patra, are first cousins, and they live in a village called Andaria, their houses being only 3 or 4 cubits apart from each other."
FACTS,"They had a dispute about a pathway adjoin ing their houses, which led to a tank, and they quarrelled about it on the 11th July, 1949."
FACTS,"Two days later, on the lath July, when Kumad Patra was washing his hands at the brink of the village tank, the appellant came from behind and inflicted on him 17 injuries."
FACTS,with the result that two of his fingers had to be amputated and a piece of bone had to be extracted from his left thumb.
FACTS,"The police being informed, started investigation and submitted a charge sheet against the appellant who was finally committed to the Court of Sessions and tried by the Sessions Judge and a jury."
FACTS,"He was charged under section 307 of the Indian Penal Code, but the jury returned a verdict of guilty against him under section 326 of the Penal Code, and the learned Sessions Judge accepting the verdict convicted him under that section as aforesaid."
FACTS,"When the matter came up in appeal to the High Court, a rule was issued on the appellant calling upon him to show cause why his sentence 204 should not be enhanced, but, at the final hearing, the rule was discharged, his appeal was dismissed, and his conviction and the original sentence were upheld."
FACTS,"The first point urged on behalf of the appellant before us is that, inasmuch as there was no charge under section 326 of the Penal Code and the offence under that section was not a minor offence with reference to an offence under section 307 of the Code, he could not have been convicted under the former section."
FACTS,This argument however overlooks the provisions of section 237 of the Criminal Procedure Code.
FACTS,"That section, after referring to section 236 which provides that alternative charges may be drawn up against an accused person where it is doubtful which of several of fences the facts which can be proved will constitute, states as follows : ""If . . the accused is charged with one offence, and it appears in evidence that he committed a different offence for which he might have been charged under the provisions of that section, he may be convicted of the offence which he is shown to have committed, although he was not charged with it."
FACTS,""" There can be no doubt that on the facts of this case, it was open to the Sessions Judge to charge the appellant alternatively under sections 307 and 326 of the Penal Code."
FACTS,The case therefore clearly falls under section 237 of the Criminal Procedure Code and the appellant 's conviction under section 326 of the Penal Code was proper even in the absence of a charge.
PRECEDENT,"In Begu vs The King Emperor (1) the Privy Council had to deal with a case where certain persons were charged under section 302 of the Penal Code, but were convicted under section 201 for causing the disappearance of evidence."
PRECEDENT,"Their Lordships upheld the conviction, and while referring to section 237 of the Criminal Procedure Code, they ob served: ""A man may be convicted of an offence, although there has been no charge in respect of it, if the evidence is such as to establish a charge that might have (1) (1925) 52 I.A. 191, 205 been made ."
PRECEDENT,Their Lordships entertain no doubt that the procedure was a proper procedure and one warranted by the Code of Criminal Procedure.
FACTS,""" The second point urged on behalf of the appellant is that the High Court having issued a rule for the enhancement of the sentence, he should have been allowed to argue the merits of the case which he was not allowed to do."
FACTS,"The learned counsel for the appellant was not, however, able to show that even if it was open to him to argue on the merits of the case the decision would have been otherwise."
FACTS,"Only three contentions were put forward by him, these being : (1) that several material witnesses were not examined; (2.) that the appellant 's case was not placed before the jury in a fair manner; and (3) that there was no proper examination of the appel lant under section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code."
REASONING,We have examined these contentions and find that they are entirely without merit.
REASONING,"In urging his first contention, the learned counsel stated that though it was admitted that several persons have got houses to the east, north and north west of the tank where the occurrence is alleged to have taken place, they have not been examined by the prose cution."
REASONING,"He further argued that one Sarat Chandra Ghose, who was present at the house of the accused when it was searched, has also not been examined."
REASONING,"These arguments however have very little force, since there is no evidence to show that those persons had seen the occurrence, an d they also do not take note of the fact that such evidence as has been adduced by the prosecution, if believed, was suffi cient to support the conviction of the appellant."
REASONING,"The Ses sions Judge in his charge to the jury referred specifically to the very argument urged before us, and he told 'the jurors that if they thought it fit it was open to them to draw an inference against the prosecution."
REASONING,There can be no doubt that the jurors were 27 206 properly directed on the point and they evidently thought that the evidence before them was sufficient for convicting the appellant.
REASONING,"The second contention urged on behalf of the appellant relates to his defence, which, briefly stated, was that Kumad Patra, the injured man, entered his house during his temporary absence, went to the bedroom of his wife, who was a young lady, and committed indecent assault on her and was assaulted in these circumstances."
REASONING,"This story was not sup ported by any evidence but was merely suggested in cross examination, and the Sessions Judge while referring to it in his charge to the jury, observed: ' 'If I were left alone, I would not have believed the defence version."
REASONING,"But you are not bound to accept my opin ion, nor you should be influenced by it It is for you to decide whether you will accept the defence suggestion in favour of which there is no such positive evidence."
REASONING,""" The Sessions Judge undoubtedly expressed himself some what strongly with regard to the defence suggestion, but he coupled his observations, which we think he was entitled to make, with an adequate warning to the jurors that they were not bound to accept his opinion and should not be influenced by it."
REASONING,"The defence version was rejected by the jury, and there can be no doubt that on the materials on the record it would have been rejected by any court of fact."
REASONING,The last contention put forward by the learned counsel for the appellant was that he was not examined as required by law under section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code.
REASONING,It appears that three questions ware put to the appellant by the Sessions Judge after the conclusion of the prosecution evidence.
REASONING,"In the first question, the Sessions Judge asked the appellant what his defence was as to the evidence ad duced, against him; in the second question, the Judge re ferred to the dispute about the pathway and asked the appel lant whether he had inflicted injuries on Kumad Patra; and in the third question, the appellant was asked."
REASONING,207 whether he would adduce any evidence.
REASONING,"The facts of the case being free from any complications and the points in issue being simple, we find it difficult to hold that the examina tion of the appellant in this particular case was not ade quate."
REASONING,"To sustain such an argument as has been put forward, it is not sufficient for the accused merely to show that he has not been fully examined as required by section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code, but he must also show that such examination has materially prejudiced him."
REASONING,"In the present case, it appears that the point urged here was not raised in the grounds of appeal to the High Court, nor does it find a place in the grounds of appeal or in the statement of case filed in this court."
REASONING,"It has nowhere been stated that the accused was in any way prejudiced, and there are no materi als before us to hold that he was or might have been preju diced."
REASONING,"We have read the Sessions Judge 's charge to the jury, which is a very fair and full charge, and nothing has been shown to us to justify the conclusion that the verdict of the jury should not have been accepted."
RPC,The appeal accordingly fails and is dismissed.
RPC,Appeal dismissed.

FACTS,Both the appellants went up in revision against this decision to the High Court but without any success.
FACTS,"An application was then made under article 136 of the Constitution of India for special leave to appeal and this was allowed by this Court on 24th March, 1950 The appellant, Nargundkar, is a member of the Central Provinces & Berar Provincial Service and held the substan tive post of Deputy Commissioner for several years."

Doongaji (P. W. 4) were divulged to accused 2 (R. section Patel), who was allowed to substitute another tender (Exhibit P 3A), containing rates lower than those of Doongaji, that thereafter these open tenders were brought to the office on the 11th November, 1946, and given to Amarnath (P.W. 20) who was the Assistant Commissioner of Excise, for submitting a report and that on the recommendation of Nar gundkar the tender of accused 2 (Patel) was accepted and the contract was given to him."
FACTS,"In May, 1947, on receipt of an application (Exhibit P 1) from one Dilbagrai (P. W. 14), enquiries were started by the Anti Corruption Department."
FACTS,Both the accused became aware of the enquiry.
FACTS,"In order to create evidence in their favour they brought into existence a letter (Exhibit P 24) and antedated it to 20th November, 1946."
FACTS,This document was forged with the intention of com mitting fraud and of causing injury to Amarnath (P. W. 20) and also to Doongaji (P.W. 4).

FACTS,"File"", and marked to Superintendent ""S"" was not made on the 21st November, 1946, which date it bears."
FACTS,"This letter was handed over by accused 1 to the Office Superintendent, S.W.

FACTS,"Both the accused denied the commission of the offences of criminal conspiracy, forgery and abetment thereof."
FACTS,"Nargundkar denied having attended office on the 9th Novem ber, 1946."
FACTS,He denied having taken the tenders home.
FACTS,"Ac cording to him, the tenders were opened by him in the office on the 1095 11th November, 1946."
FACTS,"Accused 2 denied that the tender of Doongaji was shown to him by accused 1 between the 9th and 11th November, 1946."
FACTS,"He stated that the tender (Exhibit P 3A) was the original tender submitted by him on the 31st October, 1946."
FACTS,"As regards Exhibit P 24, it was denied that it was fabricated or antedated."
FACTS,Accused 2 stated that it was not typed on article A.
FACTS,He also alleged that the allegations made in Exhibit P 24 were correct.
FACTS,"Accused Nargundkar stated that the endorsement was made by him on the 21st November, 1946."
FACTS,"The first charge having failed, nothing need be said about it herein."
FACTS,"In order to prove the second charge the prosecution had to establish that Gadgil, P.W. 13, handed over the sealed tenders on the 9th November, 1946, to accused Nargundkar, that the latter took them home, that between the 9th and the 11th November he met Patel at his house or elsewhere and that accused."
FACTS,"Nargundkar showed or communicated the particu lars of the tender of Doongaji to accused Patel who substi tuted Exhibit P 3A for his original tender before the 11th November, 1946."
FACTS,"Admittedly there is no direct evidence to prove any of these facts except the first one, and the nature of the case is such that recourse could only be had to circumstantial evidence to establish those facts."
FACTS,The fact that the sealed tenders were handed over by Gadgil to accused Nargundkar on the 9th November has been held proved solely on the uncorroborated testimony of Gadgil as against the denial of Nargundkar.
FACTS,Gadgil was himself a suspect in the case.
FACTS,"He was kept by the police away from the office for about eight months during the investigation, he was asked to proceed on leave at the instance of the police and his leave was extended at their request."
FACTS,On the expiry of his leave he was kept off duty without salary for a period of about five months but later on he was paid his full salary after he had given evidence in support of the prosecution.
FACTS,"He made addi tions and improvements on vital points from stage to stage of his deposition and in certain particulars his statement was contradicted by Ramaswami, P.W. 80."
FACTS,"On his own admission he is an accomplice in respect 1096 of the forgery of Exhibit P 27, one of the documents al leged to have been forged for purposes of the defence but concerning which no prosecution was started."
FACTS,"Exhibit P 27 bears date 31st October, 1946."
FACTS,"Gadgil 's statement about it is as follows: ""He (Nargundkar) put down his signature and the date 31st October, 1946."
FACTS,This order was actually written by Sh.
FACTS,"Nargundkar in the note sheet, Exhibit P 27, in the month of July or August, 1947."
FACTS,The dates were antedated.
FACTS,"In the margin of the note sheet I have put down my initials S.W.G. and put the date 31st October, 1946."
FACTS,"This note sheet was not prepared on gist October, 1946."
FACTS,He asked me to keep it in my custody.
FACTS,""" The witness admittedly became a party to the preparation of a forged document."
FACTS,"Whether he was telling the truth, or he was telling a lie, as appears likely from his cross examination, he is in either event, not a person on whom any reliance could be placed."
FACTS,It is curious that this aspect of the evidence of Gadgil has not been noticed by any of the three courts below.
FACTS,"When the court of first instance and the court of appeal arrive at concurrent findings of fact after believing the evidence of a witness, this court as the final court does not disturb such findings, save in most exceptional cases."
FACTS,"But where a finding of fact is arrived at on the testimony of a witness of the character of Gadgil and the courts below depart from the rule of prudence that such testimony should not be accepted unless it is corroborated by some other evidence on the record, a finding of that character in the circumstances of a particular case may well be reviewed even on special leave if the other circumstances in the ease require it, and substantial and grave injustice has result ed."
FACTS,"After fully examining the material on the record we have reached the conclusion that the courts below were in error in accepting the uncorroborated testimony of Gadgil to find the fact that he handed over the tenders to Nargund kar on the 9th November, 1946."
FACTS,The witness was not allowed to live in a free atmosphere and was kept under police 1097 surveillance during the whole of the period of investigation and the trial and was rewarded with payment of his full salary after he had given evidence to the satisfaction of the prosecution.
FACTS,He is a person who felt no hesitation in deposing on oath that he willingly became a party to the forgery of Exhibit 13 27.
FACTS,"Assuming that the accused Nargundkar had taken the tenders to his house, the prosecution, in order to bring the guilt home to the accused, has yet to prove the other facts referred to above."
FACTS,No direct ' evidence was adduced in proof of those facts.
FACTS,"Reliance was placed by the prosecution and by the courts below on certain circumstances, and intrinsic evidence contained in the impugned document, Exhibit P 3A."
REASONING,In dealing with circumstantial evidence the rules specially applicable to such evidence must be borne in mind.
PRECEDENT,"In such cases there is always the danger that conjecture or suspi cion may take the place of legal proof and therefore it is right to recall the warning addressed by Baron Alderson to the jury in Reg vs Hodge (1) where he said : ""The mind was apt to take a pleasure in adapting circum stances to one another, and even in straining them a little, if need be, to force them to form parts of one connected whole; and the more ingenious the mind of the individual, the more likely was it, considering such matters, to over reach and mislead itself, to supply some little link that 'is wanting, to take for granted some fact consistent with its previous theories and necessary to render them complete."
REASONING,""" It is well to remember that in cases where the evidence is of a circumstantial nature,the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should in the first instance be fully established, and all the facts so estab lished should be consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused."
REASONING,"Again, the circumstances should be of a conclusive nature and tendency and they should be such as to exclude every hypothesis but the one proposed to be proved."
REASONING,"In (1) 141 1098 other words, there must be a chain of evidence so far com plete as not to leave any reasonable ground for a conclusion consistent with the innocence of the accused and it must be such as to show that within all human probability the act must have been done by the accused."
REASONING,"In spite of the force ful arguments addressed to us by the learned Advocate Gener al on behalf of the State we have not been able to discover any such evidence either intrinsic within Exhibit P 3A or ,outside and we are constrained to observe that the courts below have just fallen into the error against which warning was uttered by Baron Alderson in the above mentioned case."
REASONING,The trial magistrate was of the opinion that friendship between the two accused was of a very rapid growth and that their relations were very intimate and accused 2 was in a position to influence accused 1.
REASONING,He thus found that there was motive for the commission of the crime.
RLC,The learned Sessions Judge disagreed with this finding and the High Court agreed with the Sessions Judge on this point.
REASONING,It observed that the evidence which tended to prove friendship or undue favour was not such as to form the basis for a finding.
REASONING,It further found that there was nothing to show that the appellant Nargundkar received any illegal reward or the promise of one for showing Doongaji 's tender to accused R.S. Patel.
REASONING,The first circumstance therefore on which the trial Judge placed considerable reliance was negatived by the court of appeal and in revision.
REASONING,"It having been found that there was no motive whatsoever for accused Nargundkar to show the tenders to accused Patel and to take a substi tuted tender from him, the main link in the chain of reason ing of the trial court vanishes."
REASONING,Amiable relations between the two accused or their official relationship could not be regarded as sufficient motive for committing the crime of forgery.
REASONING,"The mainstay of the prosecution case is the intrinsic evidence of the contents of Exhibit P 3A itself which ac cording to the courts below are unusual, peculiar and strange and which according to the Advocate General could not be there if it was a genune 1099 document."
REASONING,The argument would have force provided the prem ises on which it is based are correct.
REASONING,"Having examined the contents of Exhibit P 3A, we do not find anything very unusual or extraordinary in it which could not be there without its author having seen Exhibit P 6."
REASONING,We now proceed to examine the so called peculiar features in Exhibit P 3A.
REASONING,In order to appreciate the points made by the learned Advocate General it is necessary to set out certain facts.
REASONING,Exhibit P 9 is the notice calling for tenders for the supply of country spirit in the Seoni distillery area.
REASONING,The rates which were called for by this notice were as follows: 1.
REASONING,Flat rate for four years.
REASONING,Rates on sliding scale for four years.
REASONING,All in rate on the sliding scale for one year 1947 48. 4.
REASONING,Flat rates on the basis of the price of mahua flowers for three years 1948 51. 5.
REASONING,All in sliding scale rate on the basis of the price of mahua flowers for three years 1948 51.
REASONING,"The trial magistrate held on a construction of it that no rate or rates of separate years were asked for in this notice and that one flat rate was only asked for, for four years."
REASONING,"Habibur Rahman and Zakirur Rahman in their tenders, Exhibits P 4 and P 5, quoted one flat rate for four years and did not mention separate flat rates for separate years."
REASONING,"Doongaji in his tender, Exhibit P 6, mentioned separate flat rates for each separate year also."
REASONING,"He did so because he consulted one Mr. Munshi, Personal Assistant to the Excise Commissioner, whether he should quote each rate separately and Mr. Munshi told him that he could give flat rate for the combined years as well as flat rates and also sliding scale rates for each year separately."
REASONING,"Admittedly accused 2 was working as an agent of Habibur Rahman and his son Zakirur Rahman for the distillery contracts of Betul and Seoni, and, therefore, he must have been the author not only of his own tender but of the tenders submitted by Habibur Rahman and Zakirur Rahman, Exhibits 1100 P 4 and P 5."
REASONING,All of them were acting together with the object of getting the contract though they were submitting three separate tenders.
REASONING,"The trial magistrate held that as Habibur Rahman and Zakirur Rahman gave one flat rate for four years as called for by Exhibit P 9, but accused 2, the author of all these tenders, did not do it in Exhibit P 3A, but followed the method of Doongaji in giving the rates of each year separately as well as the rate for the combined four years."
REASONING,"lie must have done so as he was shown the tender Exhibit P section The question arises whether the circumstance that the accused Patel and Habibur Rahrnan and Zakirur Rahman were acting together was such from which a necessary inference arises that the accused Patel must have been the author of all the three tenders and, if he were, that he could not have departed from the method adopted by him in preparing Exhibits P 4 and P 5 unless and until he had seen Exhibit P 6."
REASONING,We are clearly of the opinion that from the premises stated this inference does not necessarily follow.
REASONING,"Doongaji even after reading Exhibit P 9, could not make up his mind whether to submit the tender with one flat rate for all the four years or whether to submit it by giving sepa rate flat rates for each of the four years and made enquiry from the office of the Excise Commissioner and then quoted separate rates for each of the four years separately also."
REASONING,Patel who has admittedly considerable experience of distill ery contracts and about the method of submitting tenders might very well have thought that it was best to quote a flat rate for all the years as well as a flat rate for each year separately.
REASONING,The circumstance that he did not do so in the other two tenders prepared by him does not materially advance the prosecution case.
REASONING,The very object of submitting several tenders on behalf of three persons acting in unison was to indicate to the excise authorities that they were being submitted by three different persons.
REASONING,If there were no variations whatsoever between those tenders that would have defeated the very purpose of submitting them.
REASONING,"More over, a variation of this trifling nature between Exhibits P 3A and P 4 1101 and P 5 cannot be said to be of such an unusual or of such an extraordinary character as to warrant the inference that it could not have been made except without a look at the tender of Doongaji."
REASONING,"The circumstance is of a neutral charac ter and the trial magistrate and the learned Sessions Judge gave undue importance to it, being obsessed with the idea that such a quotation of flat rates for each year could not be mentioned in a tender by a contractor merely on a con struction of Exhibit P 9 and without any further inquiry or without seeing the tender of somebody else who had followed that method."
REASONING,"The next circumstance on which considerable reliance is placed is that accused 2 studiously maintained rates below the rates of Doongaji throughout, that when Doongaji lowered his rates for the second year accused 2 did the same, and when Doongaji raised his rates for the third and fourth years accused 2 also did so, at the same time maintaining rates lower than Doongaji 's rates."
REASONING,"It is said that the system followed by Habibur Rahman and Zakirur Rahman and Patel originally must have been the same as Patel was the author of all the three tenders, that Habibur Rahman 'srates were higher than Zakirur Rahman 's by six pies and this variation was constant throughout, that in Patel 's original tender which must have followed the same system his rates would be lower than Habibur Rahman 's by three pies through out."
REASONING,"Exhibit P 3A, however, shows that this is not so."
REASONING,Patel abandoned the system when he found that his rates on his original scheme would be higher than the correspond ing rates of Doongaji.
ARG,"Learned Advocate General contended that it was impossible for Patel unless he had seen Exhibit P 6, to quote rates of a large number of items numbering about 197, in every case lower than the rates given in Exhibit P 6 and the circumstance that in not a single case he has quoted a higher rate than Exhibit P 6 is conclusive of the fact that he had done so after he had seen Exhibit P 6."
ARG,It was also said that there is no satisfactory explana tion why Patel abandoned the scheme adopted by him in 1102 drawing up Exhibits P 4 and P 5 and his original tender.
REASONING,"In our view, this circumstance again is not so strange or peculiar as was made out by the learned Advocate General or in the courts below."
REASONING,"In the first place, there is no material whatsoever for the assumption that the so called original tender was drawn up on the same scheme as Exhibits P 4 and P 5 or that there was a constant variation in rates between it and Habibur Rahman 's tender."
REASONING,"It has been assumed on mere surmise that the first five rates in the tender, Exhibit P 3A, are the rates that had been originally quoted."
REASONING,The original tender is not forthcoming and there is no evidence at all about its contents.
REASONING,"Moreover, in the depo sition of Doongaji it was elicited that in the year 1942 when tenders for the Seoni distillery contract were called for, the rates quoted by Ratanshah were lower than his rates for all items."
REASONING,"He, however, voluntarily added that Ratanshah obtained his rates of the previous contracts before he submitted his tender for the year 1942 and that he had made a reduction of annas two to three in those rates but he was forced to admit that the rate of Ratanshah in the tender was not only lower than his but was also lower throughout than the rates of Laxminarain, Haji Ismail and Habibur Rahman even without seeing their tenders."
REASONING,From this statement it is quite clear that even without seeing the tenders of differ ent tenderers a contractor may quote rock bottom rates of all items on his own calculation or impelled by the desire of taking the contract anyhow.
REASONING,We do not follow why Patel could not do in 1946 what was done by Ratanshah in his tenders in 1942 and quote rates lower in all particulars and regarding all items than the rates of Doongaji.
REASONING,"If a person is out to give rockbottom rates and his calculation is such that his rates work out lower than the rates of others, it may well be that he may quote lower rates in respect of all items."
REASONING,"It was then said that Patel had adopted a particular plan in submitting the three tenders, of himself, Habibur Rahman and Zakirur Rahman and that his plan was that his rates should be less by three pies 1103 than the rates he had quoted for Habibur Rahman, that in the first five items of Exhibit 145 he stuck to that plan and did not alter the rates of those items as originally submit ted by him, as those rates were lower than the rates of Doongaji but from the sixth item onwards he substituted new rates for the ones he had originally submitted and he de parted from the plan so that his rates for each item were to be lower only by three pies as compared with the rates of Habibur Rahman."
REASONING,It is no doubt true that Patel did not adhere to the plan that he adopted in the first five items of his tender but is that a circumstance from which any inference can be drawn that the first five items are a part of his original tender or that he did so depart from them because he had seen Exhibit P 6 and he wanted to underbid Doongaji.
REASONING,"As we have already said, the object of submitting three separate tenders ostensibly by persons who were acting together was to secure the contract in one or the other name and Patel who was the author of all the three documents may very well in his own document have quoted much lower figures than were quoted by Habibur Rahman and Zakirur Rahman, in order also to give the impression that all these tenders had not been submitted by one and the same person."
REASONING,"Be that as it may, a closer examination of the tenders of Doongaji and Patel completely negatives the theory of the courts below."
REASONING,"The rates quoted in the first five items of Exhibit P 145 are lower than the rates of Doongaji by 102, 69, 18, 12 and 9 pies respectively."
REASONING,"Even in the subsequent quotations except in one case where the disparity in the tales of Doongaji and Patel is only two pies, the disparity in the rates is from 9 to 11 pies."
REASONING,Patel is certainly a businessman and the whole object of quoting the rates was to earn the maximum profit.
REASONING,If he had seen the tender of Doongaji he would have modelled the rates in a manner that would give him the highest profit.
REASONING,"The learned Advocate General could not suggest any reason whatsoever why Patel would maintain his quotation for the quantity of 50,000 gallons at Rs, 2 10 6 when the rate of Doongaji was Rs. 3 3 0 1104 He could easily raise the quotation to Rs. 3 and similarly in all other cases he could have underbid Doongaji by 2, 3 or 6 pies at the most."
REASONING,He need not have maintained a dis parity of 9 to 11 pies between his rates and the rates of Doongaji.
REASONING,"In our opinion, therefore, no conclusion of any character could be drawn from the disparity in the rates of Doongaji or of Patel or of the expected uniformity in the rates of Habibur Rahman or of R.S. Patel which would estab lish that Exhibit P 3A had been prepared by having a look at Exhibit P 6."
REASONING,Another circumstance on which reliance was placed was that certain rates in Exhibit P 3A are lower than the corre sponding rates in Exhibit P 6 by only one or two pies.
REASONING,"There is no doubt that one or two rates are lower by two pies than the rates in Exhibit P 6 but nothing follows from that innocent circumstance, unless one starts with a pre sumption of guilt."
REASONING,"Once it is assumed that the tender of Doongaji was shown to Patel, all these circumstances might to some extent fit in with the view that in certain respects it may have been copied from Exhibit P 6."
REASONING,The courts below fell into this error and departed from the rule that in a criminal case an accused person is to be presumed to be innocent and that it is for the prosecution to establish his guilt conclusively.
REASONING,"Next it was urged that in the covering letter Exhibit P 3 sent by Patel he mentions three appendices numbered 1, 2 and 3, The same expression finds place in the covering letter Exhibit P 4 of Habibur Rahman and Exhibit P~5 of Zakirur Rahman, that appendices 1 to a of the tender of Habibur Rahman and Zakirur Rahman correctly answer to the reference in the covering letters but this is not so in Patel 's case; on the other hand, instead of appendix 1, Patel has appendix 1 (a) and 1 (b) and the number of his appendices thus goes up to four and this departure from Exhibits P 4 and P 5 came about because of his having seen Exhibit P 6 and the number of appendices annexed to it."
REASONING,It was urged that the original tender of Patel must have contained three appendices like those of Habibur Rahman and 1105 Zakirur Rahman and not appendix l(a) and l(b) as now found and that this circumstance showed substitution of the 'tender.
REASONING,"The learned magistrate, in our opinion, in giving importance to this circumstance mislead himself completely."
REASONING,"In the first place, it is not accurate to say that the expression appendices 1, 2 and 3 was common to the covering letters Exhibts P 4 and P 5."
REASONING,"In Exhibit P 5 the appen dices are marked A, B and C. Therefore, no uniform method was adopted by Patel in marking the appendices to the ten ders, Exhibits P 4 and P 5."
REASONING,"Secondly, there is no conflict in the expression of the appendices of Habibur Rahman and Patel."
REASONING,"They have been marked as 1, 2 and 3 and a mere subdi vision of the first appendix into (a) and (b) could not be taken to be a departure from the method adopted in the description of the appendices."
REASONING,"It may further be observed that the covering letter signed by Patel mentions four appendices, while the covering letters of Habibur and Zaki rur Rahman only mention three appendices."
REASONING,The trial magis trate as well as the Sessions Judge ignored all these dif ferences in the method of the description of the appendices and assumed that they had been uniformly described.
REASONING,The result therefore is that all these so called peculiar features found by the courts below in Exhibit P 3A should be eliminated from consideration and it must be held that there are really no circumstances inconsistent with Exhibit P 3A being a genuine document.
REASONING,It could have been made out without looking at Exhibit P 6.
REASONING,"In this view of the case the whole basis on which the judgments of the courts below are founded vanishes, and in the absence of any evidence of motive, we are of the opinion that the facts did not on any just or legal view of them warrant a conviction, and al though the proceedings are taken to have been unobjection able in form, justice has gravely and injuriously miscar ried."
REASONING,"We therefore set aside the conviction of both the appellants on the second charge and acquit them, 142 1106 In order to appreciate the third charge, it is necessary to set out the terms of Exhibit P 24 which it is said was antedated in order to create evidence for the defence of the accused and to injure Amarnath."
REASONING,"It is in these terms: Congress Nagar, Nagpur, 20th November, 1946."
REASONING,"The Commissioner of Excise, C.P. & Berar, Nagpur."
REASONING,"Dear Sir, I beg to submit few of my complaints for such action as you may be pleased to take, which are as under."
REASONING,"I went to see Mr. Amarnath last week, at his residence in connection with Seoni Distillery work."
REASONING,I saw Mr. Edulji and his partner with Mr. Amarnath in the office room of his residence with some office files.
REASONING,From the papers I could recognize my tender open on the table in front of them.
REASONING,"As soon as I went there, all of them were astonished and they could not speak with me for a moment, and then they carried on some dry general conversation with me."
REASONING,"Same way after about a week, when I went to Seoni for mahua bill, when Mr. Amarnath visited for sanctioning the advance, I had the opportunity to see Mr. Amarnath in dak bungalow at about 9 30 p.m. when I saw Mr. Mehta the ex manager of Mr. Edulji (who is also the manager of Seoni Electric Co.) with Mr. Amarnath near table with the same file of the tender."
REASONING,No doubt after seeing the above two incidents I requested Mr. Amarnath to be fair in this af fair.
REASONING,"I am bringing these incidents to your notice, as I fear that something underhand may not be going on, and I am afraid that my tender may be tampered with."
REASONING,"Hoping to get justice, Yours faithfully, Sd."
REASONING,R.S. Patel.
REASONING,""" 1107 The words ""Congress Nagar, Nagpur, 20th November, 1946"" are in manuscript, while the rest of the letter has been typed."
REASONING,The digit 6 of the year 1946 has been over written on digit 7 written in continental style and it is apparent to the naked eye that originally the writer wrote 7 and subsequently changed it to 6.
ARG,"It was contended by the learned Advocate General, and this is the finding of the courts below, that this letter was written some time during the investigation of the case in July or August 1947, and was antedated in order to implicate Amarnath and to use it as evidence in defence."
REASONING,The point for decision is wheth er there is any evidence whatsoever to establish this act.
REASONING,We have not been able to discover any such evidence on the record; on the other hand the intrinsic evidence in the letter proves that most likely it came into existence on the date it bears.
REASONING,"The relevant facts are that the tenders were opened by accused Nargundkar on the 11th November, 1946, he handed them over after making the endorsements to Amarnath and Amarnath had to submit a report about them."
REASONING,"It is alleged in this letter that ""last week"", i.e., during the week commencing on the 11th November, 1946, accused Patel went to see Amarnath and there he saw Edulji Doongaji with him with his tender open on his table in front of him and that he was astonished at it, that about a week later he again went to Seoni and had the opportunity to see Amarnath and Mr. Mehta, ex manager of Edulji Doongaji, was with him and the tender file was lying there."
REASONING,It was stated that he had requested Amarnath to be fair in this affair and the Commissioner was asked that he should see that his tender was not tampered with and he got justice.
REASONING,The whole purpose and object of this letter was to protect himself against any underhand dealing in the granting of the contract.
REASONING,"In his statement under section 342, Cr. P.C., Patel said that he saw Amarnath on the morning of the 15th or 16th November, 1946, and he met Amarnath at Seoni at the distillery prem ises on the 16th November, 1946, and on the same 1108 day he met him at about 9 p.m. at the Seoni dak bungalow and that he again met him on the 17th November, at 10 a.m."
REASONING,He also stated that he had gone to see Amarnath at his resi dence at Nagpur between the dates 12th and 18th November.
ARG,It was contended by the learned Advocate General that his statement was inconsistent with the recitals contained in Exhibit P 24.
REASONING,We see nothing inconsistent between this statement and the recitals.
REASONING,"If accused Patel saw Amarnath on the 12th, the letter having been written on the 20th November, it would be quite a correct thing to say that he saw him ""last week"" and the next recital when he said that about a week thereafter he saw him again is quite consistent with his going and seeing him on the 16th or 17th November."
REASONING,That would be about a week after the first visit.
REASONING,"To draw any conclusion adverse to the accused from a slight inaccu racy in the description of dates and to conclude therefrom that it was established that the accused Patel had seen Amarnath on the 9th November, 1946, amounts to unnecessari ly stretching a point against the accused."
REASONING,"The recitals in the letter, true or false, are quite consistent with the letter bearing date 20th November, 1946."
REASONING,The magistrate observed that the vagueness about the date and the week shows that the allegations therein are not correct.
REASONING,We have not been able to understand how the vagueness about the date could lead to the conclusion arrived at.
REASONING,Emphasis was laid on the overwriting of the figure 6 over the figure 7 in the manuscript part of the letter.
REASONING,It was said that the normal experience is that it becomes a subconscious habit to automatically write the year correctly when several months have elapsed after the change of the year and that by sheer force of habit the correct year must have been put down when the date was entered in the letter Exhibit P 24 and that the figure was subsequently changed to 6 and this fact was an indication that the letter was written some time in the year 1947.
REASONING,In our view this argument again involves an element 1109 of conjecture.
REASONING,The mistake may well have been inadvertent ly made and the correction made there and then.
REASONING,"That such mistakes are not very uncommon or unusual and occur in official documents is fully established on the record, in para 93 of the judgment of the learned Sessions Judge and it is said as follows: ""The appellants have produced a file which is Exhibit ID 35."
REASONING,It contains a sheet which bears pages 9 and 10.
REASONING,On the 10th page there are two office notes one is written by A.M. Naidu and the other by the appellant Nargundkar.
REASONING,A.M. Naidu below his signature has written '6 4 1948 '.
REASONING,The appellant Nargundkar below his signature has written '6 4 1947 '.
REASONING,"The other notes in the office file show that the correct date of the two signatures was 6th August, 1947."
REASONING,Thus in this sheet there are two mistakes in mentioning the number of the month and one mistake in mentioning the number of the year.
REASONING,The appellants contend that such mistakes are possible.
REASONING,"Nobody can deny that such mistakes are possible; but it has to be decided what inferences can be drawn from such mistakes, if there is other evidence also."
REASONING,""" We have looked in vain for other evidence to prove that the letter was not written on 'the date it bears."
REASONING,"Even Gadgil could not explain why he said that the letter was written in July, 1946."
REASONING,It is clear that he is not telling the ' truth in this respect.
REASONING,"The endorsement made on the letter by accused Nargundkar clearly bears the date 21st November, 1946, and if this letter was not given to him on the date of the endorsement and was given to him several months afterwards he would in ordinary course have made some note either on the letter or in the receipt register of his office when that letter was received by him."
REASONING,Then it was said that this letter was not in the file of the tenders which were kept separate.
REASONING,The Commissioner had noted that the letter be filed and he sent it to the office.
REASONING,"If the office people did not put it in the file, from that circum stance no adverse inference could 1110 be drawn as to the date that the letter bears."
REASONING,"It is dear that no forger would have in such a clumsy manner corrected 1947 into 1946 so as to leave the original figure ""7"" intact and thus leave evidence of its suspicious character writ large on its face."
REASONING,"There was no hurry about it, and a second letter without the alteration could easily have been typed."
REASONING,"Next it was argued that the letter was not typed on the office typewriter that was in those days, viz., article B, and that it had been typed on the typewriter article A which did not reach Nagpur till the end of 1946."
REASONING,On this point evidence of certain experts was led.
REASONING,The High Court rightly held that opinion of such experts was not admissible under the Indian Evidence Act as they did not fall within the ambit of section 45 of the Act.
REASONING,This view of the High Court was not contested before us.
REASONING,"It is curious that the learned Judge in the High Court, though he held that the evidence of the experts was inadmissible, proceeded nevertheless to discuss it and placed some reliance on it."
REASONING,"The trial magis trate and the learned Sessions Judge used this evidence to arrive at the finding that, as the letter was typed on article A which had not reached Nagpur till the end of December, 1946, obviously the letter was antedated."
REASONING,Their conclusion based on inadmissible evidence has therefore to be ignored.
REASONING,It was further held that the evidence of experts was corroborated by the statements of the accused recorded under section 342.
REASONING,"The accused Patel, when questioned about this letter, made the following statement: ""Exhibit P 31 was typed on the office typewriter article B. Exhibit P 24 being my personal complaint letter was typed by my Personal Assistant on one of the typewriters which were brought in the same office for trial, with a view to purchase."
REASONING,As this was my personal complaint no copy of it was kept in the Correspondence Files Exhibit P 34 and Exhib it P 35 just 1111 as there is no copy in these files of my tender Exhibit P 3A . . .
REASONING,"In the month of September, October and November, 194t5, several machines were brought for trial from various parties in our of rice till the typewrit er article A was purchased by National Industrial Alcohol Ltd. Company."
REASONING,""" If the evidence of the experts is eliminated, there is no material for holding that Exhibit P 24 was typed on article A."
REASONING,The trial magistrate and the learned Sessions Judge used part of the statement of the accused for arriving at the conclusion that the letter not having been typed on article B must necessarily have been typed on article A.
REASONING,Such use of the statement of the accused was wholly unwar ranted.
REASONING,It is settled law that an admission made by a person whether amounting to a confession or not cannot be split up and part of it used against him.
REASONING,An admission must be used either as a whole or not at all.
REASONING,"If the statement of the accused is used as a whole, it completely demolishes the prosecution case and, if it is not used at all, then there remains no material on the record from which any inference could be drawn that the letter was not writeen on the date it bears."
REASONING,"For the reasons given above we hold that there is no evidence whatsoever on the record to prove that this letter Exhibit P 24 was antedated and that being so, the charge in respect of forgery of this letter also fails."
REASONING,"Read as a whole, this letter cannot be said to have been written with the intention of causing any injury to Amarnath or for the purpose of creating a defence in respect of the second charge."
REASONING,The letter read as a whole is an innocuous document and its dominant purpose and intent was to safeguard the interests of accused Patel and to protect him against any underhand or unfair act of his rival contractors.
REASONING,"We cannot infer any intent to defraud or any intention to injure Amarnath, though in order to protect himself accused Patel made certain allegations against him."
REASONING,We therefore set aside the conviction of both the appellants under the third charge and acquit them.
REASONING,"1112 The result is that the consolidated appeal is allowed, the judgments of all the three courts below are set aside and the appellants are acquitted."
RPC,Appellants acquitted.

FACTS,By a Kobala executed with the permission of the Board of Revenue Raja Pramatha Nath Malia and his two sons Kumars Pashupati Nath Malia and Kshitipati Nath Malia represented by Kumar Kshitipati Nath Malia as the Manager of the Searsole Raj Wards Estate conveyed a property known as Senapati Mahal to Deva Prasanna in full settlement of his claim under the personal decree against the Raja.
FACTS,"By an agreement of even date, Deva Prasanna agreed to reconvey Senapati Mahal to the Kumars if he was paid Rs. 90,000/ within two years from that date."
FACTS,Senapati Mahal orginally belonged to the Raja but had been tranSferred by him to his two sons.
FACTS,"A creditor, however, had filed a suit under sec tion 53 of the Transfer of Property Act challenging that transfer and had actually got a decree declaring that trans fer as fradulent and void as against the creditors of the Raja 577 An appeal was filed by the Kumars which was pending at the date of the Kobala of January 4, 1939, and, in the circum stances, it was considered safer to join the Raja in the last mentioned Kobala in favour of Deva Prasanna."
FACTS,"On June 2, 1939, a petition was filed in the Court of the Subordinate Judge, Asansole, on behalf of Deva Prasanna as the decree holder."
FACTS,"It was headed ""Money Execution Case No. 118 of 1936."
FACTS,"The relevant portions of this petition were as follows; ""That the above execution case was disposed of on the 30th January 1937 with the attachment of the properties subsisting; since then the decree put into execution in the above case has been adjusted after remission of a large amount of interest by the out and out sale of certain properties by a registered Kobala dated 4th January 1939 . . . . . . . . .So there is no longer any need of the said attachment remaining subsisting."
FACTS,"It is, therefore, prayed that the attachment may be withdrawn."
FACTS,""" On the same day the following order was made on that petition: "" Heard learned pleaders for the parties."
FACTS,They jointly ask me to cancel the attachment (existing by special order) in Money exhibit 118 of 1936 though that case was dismissed.
FACTS,Order The said attachment is cancelled and the decree in question is recorded as adjusted as stated by learned plead er for the decree holder and pleader of the judgment debtor according to the adjustment mentioned but not detailed in this petition of to day.
FACTS,Make necessary notes and send this petition to the District Record Room.
FACTS,""" In the remarks column No. 22 in exhibit F the following entry was made : ""The said attachment is cancelled and the decree in question is recorded as adjusted as stated by learned 578 pleader for the D.H. and the pleader of the Judgment Debtor according to the adjustment mentioned but not detailed in this petition of to day."
FACTS,Dated 2nd June 1989.
FACTS,""" The Raja died in August, 1940, leaving the two appellants as his sons and legal representatives."
FACTS,"The Bengal Money Lend ers Act, 1940 (Bengal Act X of 1940) hereinafter called the Act, came into force on September 1, 1940."
FACTS,"On January 2, 1941, the appellants who, as the legal representatives of the Raja, became ""borrowers"" within the meaning of the Act filed the suit out of which the present appeal has arisen."
FACTS,The suit was filed by the appellants against the respondent under section 36 of the Act praying for reopening the trans actions and taking accounts and for release from all liabil ities in excess of the limits specified by law.
FACTS,"In short, they asked the Court to give them relief by exercising the powers given to the Court by section 36 of the Act."
FACTS,There was also a prayer for reconveyance of the Senapati Mahal.
FACTS,The respondent filed his written statement setting up a variety of defences rounded on merits as well as on legal pleas in bar.
RLC,"On May 8, 1941, the Subordinate Judge settled the issues and fixed June 9, 1941, ""for a preliminary hear ing of the suit and particularly of such of the issues as have been based on the pleas in bar."" Eventually, the case was taken up for preliminary hearing on September 4, 1941, and by his judgment delivered on September 8, 1941, the learned Subordinate Judge dismissed the suit on issue No. 2 which was as follows: ""Does the plaint disclose a valid cause of action for the suit ?"" The appellants preferred an appeal to the High Court at Calcutta."
RLC,"Although the High Court (R.C. Mitter and K.C. Chunder JJ.) did not accept all the reasonings on which the learned Subordinate Judge had based his decision, they, however, agreed that the appellants could get no relief as the decrees in suit No. 78 of 1922 could not be reopened, as they were not passed in 579 ""a suit to which this Act applies"" and consequently dis missed the appeal."
ARG,The appellants have now come up on appeal before us after having obtained a certificate from the High Court under section 110 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
ARG,Learned Advocate appearing in support of this appeal before us has contended that the High Court was in error in holding that the decrees in Suit No. 78 of 1922 were not liable to be reopened under the second proviso to section 36 (1).
ARG,"Learned advocate for the respondent while joining issue on this point also raised a point which, however, did not find favour with the High Court, namely, that the respondent as a bona fide assignee for value of the mortgage debt was protected by sub section (5) of section 36."
REASONING,"It is quite clear that if either of the two points is decided against the appellants, this appeal must fail."
REASONING,"The main provisions of section 36 (1)are in the follow ing terms : ""Notwithstanding anything contained in any law for the time being in force, if in any suit to which this Act ap plies, or in any suit brought by a borrower for relief under this section, whether heard ex parte or otherwise, the Court has reason to believe that the exercise of one or more of the powers under this section will give relief to the bor rower, it shall exercise all or any of the following powers as it may consider appropriate namely, shall (a) reopen any transaction and take an account between the parties; (b) notwithstanding any agreement, purporting to close previous dealings and to create new obligations, reopen any account already taken between the parties; (c) release the borrower of all liability in excess of the limits specified in clauses (t) and (2) of section 30; (d) if anything has been paid or allowed in account on or after the first day of January, 1939, in respect of the liability referred to in clause (c), order 580 the lender to repay any sum which the Court considers to be repayable in respect of such payment or allowance in account as aforesaid; (e) set aside either wholly or in part or revise or alter any security given or agreement made in respect of any loan, and if the lender has parted with the security, order him to indemnify the borrower in such manner and to such extent as it may deem just."
REASONING,""" It will be noticed (a) that the provisions of this section apply notwithstanding anything contained in any law for the time being in force, (b) that the powers conferred on the Court or to be exercised either in any suit to which this Act applies or in any suit brought by a borrower for relief under the section and (c) that the Court is called upon to exercise all or any of the powers conferred on it by the section if the Court has reason to believe that the exercise of one or more of the powers will give relief to the borrower."
REASONING,"In the present case the borrowers have insti tuted a substantive suit for relief under section 36 and, therefore, if there was nothing also in the section and the Court had the requisite belief, the Court could exercise all or any of the powers and give relief to the borrowers in terms of the prayers of the plaint."
REASONING,"There are, however, two provisions to sub section (1) of section 36."
REASONING,"The relevant portion of the second proviso is expressed in the words following: ""Provided that in exercise of these powers the Court shall not (i) * * * * (ii) do anything which affects any decree of a Court, other than a decree in a suit to which the Act applies which was not fully satisfied by the first day of January, 1939, or * * * *"" The proviso makes it quite clear that in exercise of the powers the Court cannot reopen or otherwise affect a decree of a Court unless such decree is one which was passed in a suit to which this Act applies and ' which was not fully satisfied by January 1, 1939."
PRECEDENT,"In the light of the decision of the Full Bench of the 581 Calcutta High Court in Mrityunjay Mitra vs Satis Chandra Banerji(1) which was approved by the Privy Council in Jadu Nath Roy vs Kshitish Chandra Acharyya(2), it has not been contended, in view of the fact that the personal decree for the balance remained unsatisfied on January 1, 1939, that the decrees in Suit No. 78 of 1922 were fully satisfied within the meaning of the above proviso."
PRECEDENT,"Therefore, the only thing that remains to be ascertained is whether the decrees were passed in ""a suit to which this Act applies."
PRECEDENT,""" Section 2 (22) of the Act is as follows: ""2."
PRECEDENT,"In this Act, unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context"" (22) ""Suit to which this Act applies ""means any suit or proceeding instituted or filed on or after the 1st day of January, 1939, or pending on that date and includes a pro ceeding in execution (a) for the recovery of a loan advanced before or after the commencement of this Act; (b) for the enforcement of any agreement entered into before or after the commencement of this Act, whether by way of settlement of account or otherwise, or of any security so taken, in respect of any loan advanced whether before or after the commencement of this Act; or (c) for the redemption of any security given before or after the commencement of this Act in respect of any loan advanced whether before or after the commencement of this Act."
PRECEDENT,""" The words ""instituted or filed on or after the 1st day of January, 1939, or pending on that date"" have been read and understood as qualifying the words ""any suit or proceed ing"" in the beginning of the definition as well as the words ""proceeding in execution"" occurring further down: see per Spens C.J. in Bank of ' Commerce Ltd. vs Amulya Krishna (3)."
PRECEDENT,"Accordingly, it has (1) I.L.R. 11944) 2Cal. 376; (2) L.R. 76 I.A. 179 at p. 190."
PRECEDENT,(3) ;A.I.R. 1944 F.C. 18.
PRECEDENT,"582 been held in Ram Kumar De vs Abhoya Pada Bhattacharjee (1) that where a decree is such that the suit in which it was passed had terminated before January 1, 1939, and no pro ceeding in execution was started or was actually pending on or after that date it is not a decree in ""a suit to which this Act applies""and cannot be reopened."
PRECEDENT,The same view was upheld by a Special Bench of the Calcutta High Court in Aparna Kumari vs Girish Chandra (2)which overruled two earlier decisions to the contrary.
REASONING,The construction put upon section 2 (22)by the Special Bench and the reasons given by them appear to us to be well founded.
REASONING,"In the case now before us, the Suit No. 78 of 1922 was instituted and all the three decrees were passed long before the specified date."
REASONING,"The only question that has therefore, to be consid ered is whether any proceeding in execution was pending on or after that date."
REASONING,"The answer to this question will depend on the true meaning and effect of the orders made by the executing Court (i) on January 30, 1937, and (ii) on June 2, 1939."
REASONING,"As to (i) It is not disputed that the order of January 30, 1937, was made under Order XXI, rule57, as amended by the Calcutta High Court."
REASONING,"Order XXI, rule 57, is expressed in the following terms : ""Where any property has been attached in execution of a decree but by reason of the decree holder 's default the Court is unable to proceed further with the application for execution, it shall either dismiss the application or for any sufficient reason adjourn the proceedings to a future date."
REASONING,Upon the dismissal of such application the attachment shall cease.
REASONING,""" The marginal note of the rule is determination of at tachment."
PRECEDENT,The reason why rule 57 was introduced in the Code of 1908 has been explained by Rank in C.J. in Shibnath Singh Ray vs Sheikh Saberuddin Ahmad(3) as follows: (1) ; (2) (3) I.L.R. at pp.
REASONING,"421 422 583 ""Rule 57 of Order XXI was a new provision introduced in 1908."
REASONING,"It is evident from the language of the rule itself, and it is still more evident from the circumstances under which it was passed, that it was intended to provide a remedy for the grievance or inconvenience which is apt to arise, where, after an attachment in execution, the applica tion for execution cannot further be proceeded with by reason of the decree holder 's default."
REASONING,"This was, and still is, a very common case."
REASONING,The decree holder makes some informal arrangement to give the judgment debtor time with out obtaining full satisfaction of the decree ;the applica tion for execution is not further prosecuted; it is not withdrawn; neither party attends.
REASONING,"In these circumstances, the object of the rule is to say that the Court must make either an order for adjournment or an order of dismissal."
REASONING,"The reason why it was necessary to require the Court, if it did not adjourn a proceeding to a definite date, to dismiss the application for execution formally and definitely can be amply illustrated from the decided cases."
REASONING,"In the absence of a definite order of dismissal the files of the Courts became encumbered with a number of applications for execution which were water logged and derelict, and a practice arose whereby such applications were ordered to be 'struck off. ' This was a practice not justified by the Code and in cases where attachments in execution had already been entered, the question arose whether the effect of an order 'striking off ' was that the attachment made upon application for execution was itself struck off or whether it remained notwithstanding such an order."
REASONING,Many other awkward and important questions arose out of this practice and the object of rule 57 was to ensure that this illogical and inconvenient practice should be stopped.
REASONING,Applications for execution were to be definitely dismissed if they were not adjourned to a future date.
REASONING,"The object of the last sentence in rule 57 is to settle the question whether, when the application in execution is dismissed any attachment made under that application should fall to the ground or should subsist, and 584 the legislature has provided that it is to fall to the ground."
REASONING,""" The new rule thus ' introduced left two distinct courses open to the executing Court in the situation envisaged by the rule."
REASONING,Each course had its advantage as well as its disadvantage.
REASONING,Thus the adjournment of the execution pro ceedings kept the attachment alive without any special direction.
REASONING,While the adoption of this course helped bona fide arrangement between the decree holder and the judgment debtor as to the time and manner of satisfaction of the decree it was calculated also to encourage desultory proceedings resulting in undesirable congestion in the files of the Executing Court by keeping alive so many execution proceedings.
REASONING,"On the other hand, while the dismissal of an application in the circumstances mentioned in the rule had the merit of preventing a congestion of the file by finally disposing of the application by a final order, it was calcu lated to discourage decreeholders from giving even reasona ble accommodation to the judgment debtor on account of the destruction of the attachment which left the judgment debtor free to deal with the property to the detriment of the decreeholder after the attachment ceased."
REASONING,"It was evidently with a view to preserve the advantage of a dismissal and at the same time to avoid the disadvantage of the rigid rule of cesser of the attachment that the Calcutta High Court amend ed rule 57 by adding the words ""unless the Court shall make an order to the contrary"" at the end of the last sentence of that rule."
REASONING,The rule thus amended leaves three courses open to the Executing Court in case it finds it difficult to proceed with the execution case by reason of the default of the decree holder.
REASONING,It may (1) adjourn the proceedings for good reason which will automatically keep the attachment alive or (2) simply dismiss the application which will automatically destroy the attachment or (3) dismiss the application but specifically keep alive the attachment by an express order.
REASONING,"The rule, as amended, therefore, contemplates three distinct forms of order, any one of which may be made by the Court in the 585 circumstances mentioned in the rule."
REASONING,"The question before us is as to the category in which the order made on January 30, 1937, in Execution Case No. 118 of 1936 falls."
REASONING,"It will be recalled that the order of January 30, 1937, was made on a petition (Exhibit 2) filed on that day in Execution Case No. 118 of 1936."
REASONING,"Great stress was laid by the learned advocate for the appellants on the words ""struck off for the present"" occurring in the body of that petition."
REASONING,It will be noticed that those words formed part of the request of the judgmentdebtor which was being recited in the petition.
REASONING,"In the actual prayer portion the decree holder did not use the words ""for the present"" but only asked the Court ""to strike off the execution case keeping the attachment in force."
REASONING,""" Further, apart from what the parties wanted, the Court made its intention clear in the very order that it passed and which is entered in column 20 of Exhibit F."
REASONING,The Court regarded the willingness of the the decree holder to enter into a long and protracted negotiation with the judg ment debtor as evidence of unwillingness on the part of the decree holder to diligently prosecute the execution proceedings and accordingly dismissed the execution case for non prosecution but thought fit to expressly keep alive the attachment.
REASONING,It is quite obvious that the Court made an order of the third kind mentioned above.
REASONING,The three forms of order permissible under rule 57 as amended by the High Court are quite distinct and independent of each other and there is no room for their overlapping.
REASONING,If the mere continuation of attachment will automatically convert an express order of dismissal of the execution application which is a final order into an order of adjournment which is not a final order then there was no point in the High Court taking the trouble of amending rule 57 at all.
REASONING,The Court could by simply adjourning the proceedings automatically continue the attachment without any express direction in that behalf.
REASONING,The fact that the Court gave an express direction that the attachment should continue clearly indicates that the 586 Court intended to make a final order of dismissal.
REASONING,"Again, the heading of column 20 in Exhibit F clearly indicates that only a final order is to be entered in that column."
REASONING,The fact that the order was entered in that column affords some justification for the conclusion that the Court made a final order of dismissal.
REASONING,That the claim case was automatically dropped is yet another indication that the execution case was at an end.
REASONING,"The fact that the judgment debtor had paid the full costs of the execution case is also a feature which goes to show, to a certain extent at any rate if not deci sively, that the execution proceeding was finally disposed of by the order."
REASONING,"The following endorsement appears on the petition exhibit 2 (a), dated June 2, 1939: ""Heard learned pleaders for the parties."
REASONING,"They jointly ask me to cancel the attachment (existing by special order) in Money exhibit 118 of 1936 though that case was dismissed."" This endorsement also clearly shows that the Court itself understood that the order that it made on January 30; 1937, was a final order of dismissal and that the attachment had been continued by a special order."
REASONING,"On a consideration of all these matters I have not the least doubt in my mind that the order of January 30, 1937, was in form and in substance a final order of dismissal of the Execution Case No. 118 of 1936 and that the attachment was continued by a special order such as is contemplated and authorised by the amend ment made by the Calcutta High Court in rule 57."
REASONING,Learned advocate for the appellants contended that if the execution case came to an end the attachment could not be left hanging in the air.
REASONING,There is no substance in this argument.
REASONING,"Ordi narily, an attachment is supported by an execution case and if the execution case is simply dismissed the attachment must fail with it."
REASONING,"But rule 57, as amended, expressly empow ers the Court to dismiss an execution application but at the same time to keep alive the attachment by a special order."
REASONING,That is what was done in this case.
REASONING,"Here the attachment does not, to use the expression of the learned advocate for the appellants, 587 hang in the air."
REASONING,"It rests upon the solid foundation of a special order which rule 57, as amended, in terms authorises the Court to make."
REASONING,"The continuance of the attachment, in the circumstances, needs no execution proceeding to support it."
REASONING,Take the case of an attachment before judgment.
REASONING,"Under Order XXXVIII, rule 11, where after an order of attachment before judgment a decree is passed in favour of the plaintiff, it is not necessary upon an application for execution of such a decree to apply for re attachment of the property."
REASONING,It means that the attachment continues and the judgmentdebtor cannot deal with the property to the disadvantage of the decree holder.
REASONING,"After the decree is passed, the attachment continues but nobody will say that although there has been no applica tion for the execution of the decree at any time by the decree holder there is, nevertheless, an execution proceed ing pending merely because the attachment continues."
REASONING,"Here also the attachment subsists and rests only upon the terms of Order, XXXVIII rule 11, and without any proceeding."
REASONING,"Such attachment cannot be called a proceeding in execution, for none was ever initiated after the decree was passed."
REASONING,"In my judgment, the order of January 30, 1937, was a final order which brought the Execution Case No. 118 of 1936, to an and and the attachment continued, not because there was a pend ing execution proceeding but because a special order was made under Order XXI, rule 57, as amended by the High Court."
REASONING,"As to (ii) Learned advocate for the appellants then contended that the petition (exhibit 2a) dated June 2, 1939, amounted to a proceeding in execution and as that was insti tuted and was pending after January 1, 1939 the proceedings came within the definition in section 2 (22)of ""a suit to which this Act applies""."
REASONING,I do not think this argument is sound.
REASONING,The petition (Ex.2a) was not really an application at all.
PRECEDENT,See Raja Shri Prakash Singh vs The Allahabad Bank Ltd. (1).
REASONING,"In substance, it was nothing but a certification by the decree holder of the satisfaction of the decree."
REASONING,"The mere fact (1) 33 C.W.N. 267; A.I.R. 1929 P.C. 19, 588 that the document was in the form of a petition could not convert what was really the usual certifying procedure into a proceeding in execution for recovery of a loan or for enforcement of any agreement."
REASONING,It was purely an intimation given to the Court by the decreeholder that the decree had been satisfied out of Court and the prayer for withdrawal of the attachment was merely consequential and would follow as a matter of course on full satisfaction of the decree being recorded.
REASONING,The order made on that petition also shows that the decree was recorded as adjusted and the attachment was cancelled.
REASONING,"In my judgment, that petition (exhibit 2a) was not an application such as would initiate a proceeding in execution for any of the purposes mentioned in clauses (a) or (b) or (c) of section 2 (22) of the Act."
REASONING,"For reasons stated above, the decrees sought to be reopened were not decrees made in ""a suit to which this Act applies""."
REASONING,"Suit No. 78 of 1922 was neither instituted on or after January 1, 1939, nor was it pending on that date, all the three decrees having been passed long before that date."
REASONING,Nor was any proceeding in execution such as is contemplated by section 2 (22) instituted or pending on or after that date.
REASONING,"The Execution Case No. 118 of 1936 was at an end on January 30, 1937, and the petition of June 2, 1939, was not an application at all and was certainly not a proceeding in execution within the meaning of section 2 (22) of the Act."
REASONING,This conclusion is sufficient to dismiss this appeal and it is not necessary for us to consider the other question raised by the respondent on the strength of section 36 (5) of the Act and I express no opinion on that question.
REASONING,The result is that this appeal must stand dismissed with costs and I order accordingly.
REASONING,KANIA C.J. I agree.
REASONING,PATANJALI SASTRI J.
REASONING,The facts bearing on the dispute in this appeal are fully stated in the judgment of ray brother Das which I have had the advantage of reading and it is unnecessary to recapitulate them here.
REASONING,"589 The appellant mortgagor seeks in these proceedings the reliefs provided by the Bengal Money lenders Act, 1940 (hereinafter referred to as the Act) in respect of a decree debt payable by him."
REASONING,"The respondent who represents the sub mortgagee decree holder invokes the protection of two exemptions contained in the Act: (1) Section 86 (1), proviso (ii), which exempts inter alia ""any decree other than a decree in a suit to which this Act applies which was not fully satisfied by the first day of January, 1939""."
REASONING,This raises a dispute as to whether the respondent 's decree was passed in a suit to which the Act applies.
REASONING,"(2) Section 36 (5) which exempts ""the rights of any assignee or holder for value if the Court is satisfied that the assignment to him was bona fide and that he had not received the notice re ferred to in clause (a) of sub section (1) of section 28""."
REASONING,This raises the question whether a sub mortgagee is an assignee within the meaning of the Act.
REASONING,"On the first question ""a suit to which this Act applies"" is defined in section 2 (22) as meaning ""any suit or pro ceeding instituted or filed on or after the 1st day of Janu ary, 1939, or pending on that date and includes a proceeding in execution for (among other things) the recovery of a loan advanced before or after the commencement of this Act."
REASONING,""" This definition has been construed as requiring that the ""pro ceeding in execution ""referred to therein should be pending on 1st January, 1939, and the question accordingly arises whether the order of the executing court dated 30th January, 1937, which purported to dismiss the respondent 's execution case for non prosecution while continuing the attachment already effected, terminated the proceeding in execution which had resulted in the attachment."
REASONING,"It was said that the order was made in accordance with Order XXI, rule 57, of the Civil Procedure Code as amended by the Calcutta High Court and must, therefore, be taken to have been intended to put an end to the execution proceeding altogether."
REASONING,I am not satisfied that such was the result of the dismissal.
REASONING,"The amendment which added the words ""unless the court shall make an order to the contrary"" 200 at the end of the rule envisages a dismissal of an ""applica tion for execution"" while at the same time continuing a subsisting attachment."
REASONING,"The dismissal of 30th January, 1987, must, therefore, be taken to be a dismissal of the execution application then before the court and cannot be taken to have any wider operation."
REASONING,"On the other hand, the continu ance, in express terms, of 'the attachment notwithstanding the dismissal, indicates that the proceeding which had resulted in the attachment was kept alive to be carried forward later on by sale of the attached property."
REASONING,"Attachment itself is a ""proceeding in execution"" and, so long.as it subsists, the proceeding in execution can well be regarded as pending."
PRECEDENT,"In In re Clagett 's Estate; Fordham vs Clagett (1) Jessel M.R. declared that ""a pending matter in any court of justice means one in which some proceeding may still be taken""."
REASONING,"The attachment was cancelled by the court only on 2nd June, 1939, when the decree in question was recorded as adjusted and then, and not before, could execu tion of the decree be properly considered to have terminat ed."
REASONING,"In this view, a ""proceeding in execution"" was pending on the 1st day of January, 1939, and the respondent 's decree must be taken to have been passed ""in a suit to which this Act applies ' ', with the result that the respondent 's claim to exemption under proviso (ii) to sub section (1) of sec tion 36 of the Act must fail."
REASONING,"I am, however, of opinion that the respondent 's claim to recover his decree debt is protected under section 36 (5)."
REASONING,There is no question here but that the submortgage to the respondent 's predecessor in title was bona fide.
REASONING,Nor could he have received the notice referred to in clause (a) of ' sub section (1) of section 28 as the transaction took place long before the Act was passed.
REASONING,It is not disputed that section 36 (5) applies to pre Act debts.
PRECEDENT,[See Renula Bose vs Manmatha Nath Bose(2)].
PRECEDENT,"The only question, therefore, is whether the respondent as sub mortgagee is an assignee within the meaning of sub section (5) of section 36."
PRECEDENT,"The learned (1) (2) L.R. 72 I.A. 156, 591 Judges in the court below held that he was not, following an earlier decision of their own court in Promode Kumar Roy vs Nikhil Bhusan Mukhopadhya(1)."
PRECEDENT,"That decision, however, was reversed by the Privy Council in Promode Kumar Roy vs Nikhil Bhusan Mukhopadhya(2) where their Lordships dealt with the question now before us in the following terms : ""It was suggested, in the judgment of Mitter J. (with which Waight J. agreed), and in the argument for the re spondents that if a sub mortgagee were an `assignee ' within section 36, sub section (5), of the Act."
REASONING,", certain difficul ties and anomalies would result."
REASONING,Their Lordships cannot agree with this suggestion.
REASONING,"They express no view as to the position which arises if the sub mortgage contains only a charge on the original mortgage debt, but when it contains an assignment of that debt, and of all the rights of the mortgagee, the position appears to be free from difficulty."
REASONING,"Relief can be given to the original mortgagor as against the original mortgagee under section 36, but such relief must not affect the rights of the assignee by way of sub mort gage."
REASONING,"To take an imaginary case by way of illustration, let it be assumed that the amount due on the original mortgage, for principal and interest at the original rate, is Rs. 1,000, and the sum due on the sub mortgage by assignment, for principal and interest at the original rate, is Rs. 500."
REASONING,"Let it further be assumed that if relief could be given, and were given, under section 36 as against both mortgagee and sub mortgagee, the sums due to them respectively would be Rs. 800 and Rs. 400."
REASONING,"By reason of sub section (5), the sub mortgagee 's rights cannot be affected."
REASONING,"He can therefore, as assignee of the mortgage debt: claim his full Rs. 500, as against both mortgagor and original mortgagee."
REASONING,"But if the court gives the mortgagor relief as against the original mortgagee, the mortgagor will only be liable to pay to the original mortgagee Rs. 300, the balance of the reduced debt after paying the sub mortgagee in full."
REASONING,"As to contention (b), it is impossible to read subsec tion (5) of section 36 as referring only to an assignee (1) (2) L.R. 76 I.A. 74."
REASONING,592 of a mortgage decree.
REASONING,"The words and that he had not received the notice referred to in clause (a)of subsection (1) of section 28 make it plain that an assignee of a mortgage debt is within the sub section, since section 28, sub section (1) is concerned only with assignment of debts"" (pp. 83 84)."
REASONING,"The sub mortgage here in question also contains an assignment of the debt due under the original mortgage debt and of ""the entire interest"" of the original mortgagee."
REASONING,"After reciting their original mortgage, the mortgagees proceed to state in the deed of sub mortgage: ""We mortgage all that is at present due and that will in future become due to us, the first, second, third and fourth parties, on account of the said one lakh of rupees together with interest and the entire interest under the mortgage taken by us on the basis of the said Indenture in respect of five annas share of the said Niskar Mouza Mono harbahal and in respect of sixteen annas of the surface and underground rights in the said Mouza Marichkota and we make over the said Deed of Indenture to you""."
REASONING,"The decision referred to above is, therefore, directly in point and rules the present case."
PRECEDENT,It was suggested that the said decision was inconsist ent with the earlier decisions of the same tribunal in Ram Kinkar Banerjee vs Satya Charan Srimani(1) and Jagadamba Loan Co. vs Raja Shiba Prasad Singh(2).
REASONING,"Stress was laid upon the expression ""all the rights of the mortgagee"" used by their Lordships in the passage quoted above, and it was pointed out that in the earlier decisions they held that in India a legal interest remained in the mortgagor even when the mortgage was in the form of an English mortgage, and that the interest taken by the mortgagee was not an absolute interest."
REASONING,"This proposition, it was said, implied that in a sub mortgage all the rights of the original mortgagee are not assigned to the sub mortgagee and that the mortgagee still retains a legal (1) 64 I.A. 50."
REASONING,(2) 68 I.A. 67.
REASONING,593 interest in the original mortgage.
REASONING,This is a rather super ficial view of the matter.
REASONING,In the earlier cases their Lordships were considering the quantum of interest trans ferred by a mortgagor to a mortgagee in a mortgage of leasehold interest for the purpose of determining whether or not there was privity of estate between the landlord and the mortgagee.
REASONING,"If the mortgage could operate as an assign ment of the entire interest of the mortgagor in the lease, the mortgagee would be liable by privity of estate for the burdens of the lease."
REASONING,"If on the other hand, it operated only as a partial assignment of the mortgagor 's interest, no such result would follow."
REASONING,It was in determining that issue that their Lordships held that no privity of estate arose in India because a legal interest remained in the mortgagor and the interest taken by the mortgagee was not an absolute interest.
PRECEDENT,"These cases had no bearing on the question, which arose in Promode Kumar Roy vs Nikhil Bhusan Mukhopadhya (1) and arises in the present case, as to whether a sub mortga gee becomes an assignee of the mortgage debt and of the mortgagee 's right to recover the debt from the original mortgagor."
REASONING,"The Act affords relief to certain classes of debtors by curtailing pro tanto the rights of the creditors, subject to certain exceptions in regard to ""assignments of loans""."
REASONING,In such a context the only relevant consideration could be whether the assignment is such as to establish a debtor and creditor relation between the assignee and the debtor so as to bring the case within the purview of the Act.
REASONING,"If the sub mortgagee obtained, by virtue of the sub mortgage, the right to sue the original mortgagor for recov ery of the mortgage debt, that would seem sufficient to make him an assignee within the meaning of the Act."
PRECEDENT,"It was from this point of view that the question as to the nature of the right transferred to a sub mortgagee under his sub mortgage was considered in Promode Kumar Roy vs Nikhil Bhusan Mukho padhya(1) as it has to be considered in the present case, and the reference to the sub mortgage containing an assign ment of all the rights (1) 76 I,A. 74."
REASONING,"594 of the mortgagee must, in that context, be understood with reference to the sufficiency of the right assigned to enable the sub mortgagee to sue the original mortgagor in his own right, so as to bring the relevant provisions of the Act into play as between them."
REASONING,The reservation made by their Lordships in the case of a sub mortgage containing only a charge on the original mortgage is significant and supports this view.
REASONING,"I do not consider, therefore, that there is any inconsistency between Promode Kumar Roy vs Nikhil Bhusan Mukhopadhya(1) and the earlier decisions, and even if there be any such inconsistency it has no relevance to the present case."
RPC,In the result I agree that the appeal fails and should be dismissed with costs.
RPC,Appeal dismissed.

COUNSEL,"M. C. Setalvad, Attorney General for India, (A. N. Sen, V. section Sawhney and section P. Varma, with him) for the respondents."
JUDGE,The Judgment of the Court was delivered by MUKHERJEA J.
FACTS,"This appeal is directed against a judgment of an appellate bench of the Calcutta High Court, dated the 24th February, 1953, reversing, on appeal, the judgment and order of a single Judge sitting on the Original Side of that Court, passed on an application under section 34 of the ."
FACTS,"The material facts are not in controversy and may be shortly stated as follows: On the 7th of July, 1950, the respondent, Moran and Company Limited, passed two Bought Notes to the appellant company, couched in identical terms, under which the appellant purchased 12,00,000 yards of hessian cloth, 6,00,000 yards under each contract, on certain terms and conditions stated therein."
FACTS,"The delivery was to be made every month from January, 1951, at the rate of 1,00,000 yards per month under 864 each of these notes and payments were to be made in cash 'on delivery, each delivery being treated as a separate and distinct contract."
FACTS,"The Bought Notes commenced thus: Dear Sirs, We have this day Bought by your order and on your account from our Principals."
FACTS,""" The particulars of the goods, the price, the time of delivery and other terms of the contract are then set out and amongst the terms is an arbitration clause worded as follows: "" All matters, questions, disputes, differences and/ or claims arising out of and/or concerning and/or in connection with and/or in consequence of or relating to this contract, whether or not the obligations of either or both parties under this contract be subsisting at the time of such dispute and, whether or not this contract has been terminated or purported to be terminated or completed, shall be referred to the arbitration of the Bengal Chamber of Commerce under the rules of its Tribunal of Arbitration for the time being in force and according to such rules the arbitration shall be conducted."
FACTS,""" The notes were signed by the respondent, Moran and Company, describing themselves as brokers."
FACTS,"It is admitted that the goods covered by the Bought Notes were delivered to the appellant in all the months from January to June, 1951, with the exception of the goods due to be delivered for the month of March, 1951."
FACTS,"The appellant required from the respondent delivery of goods in respect of the month of March but the latter informed the appellant, by a letter dated the 27th March, 1951, that its principals disowned a liability in this respect as there was default on the part of the appellant in not giving shipping instructions for the said goods within the time mentioned in the contracts."
FACTS,"The appellant denied any default on its part and did not also accept the position that the respondent had any principal, and on the 27th of April, 1951, it sent its bills to the respondent claiming Rs. 1,13,042 3 0 as damages for non delivery of the 865 goods."
FACTS,"As the respondent did not comply with this demand, the appellant contemplated referring the matter in dispute to the arbitration of the Bengal Chamber of Commerce as provided in the contracts and while it was preparing to take steps in that direction, the respondent, on the 11th of June, 1951, filed a suit against the appellant in the Original Side of the Calcutta High Court (being Suit No. 2516 of 1951,) and it is in respect of this suit that the application under section 34 of the has been made."
FACTS,"It was alleged in the plaint that the plaintiff acted merely as broker and in that capacity brought about the two contracts of sale and purchase evidenced by the two Bought Notes mentioned above, that the real seller was a firm known as Gowarchand Danchand, and that the plaintiff not being a party to the contract could not incur any liability under its terms."
FACTS,There were prayers in the plaint for a declaration that the plaint.
FACTS,"off was not a party to the said contracts and, that it had no liability under the same."
FACTS,"There was a further prayer for an injunction restraining the respondent from, claiming any damages in respect of the said contracts The writ of summons was served on the appellant on the 23rd of June, 1951."
FACTS,"On the 19th July, 1951, it filed an application under section 34 of the praying that the proceedings in the suit may be stayed in order that the matter in dispute between the parties may be dealt with under the arbitration clause contained in the contracts."
FACTS,The application was heard by Das Gupta J. who allowed the prayer of the applicant and stayed further proceedings in the suit.
REASONING,"In the opinion of the learned Judge the dispute in this case was not whether there was any contract entered into by and between the appellant and the respondent: but whether the respondent, who admittedly passed the two Bought Notes to the appellant, could be made liable under the contract by reason of the fact that it described itself as broker."
REASONING,The answer to this question depended according to the learned Judge upon the interpretation of the contract itself and the dispute arising as.
REASONING,it did out of or concerning or relating to the 866 contracts would come within the purview of the arbitration clause.
REASONING,Against this judgment the respondent took an appeal to the Appellate Division of the High Court and the appeal was heard by a bench consisting of Chakravartti C.J. and Sarkar J.
REASONING,"By two separate judgments which concurred in the result, the Chief Justice and the other learned Judge allowed the appeal and vacated the order for stay."
REASONING,It is against this judgment that the appellant has come to this Court on the strength of a certificate under article 133(1)(a) of the Constitution.
REASONING,"The short point for our consideration is, whether on the facts of this case, the appellant is entitled to an order under section 34 of the , staying the proceedings of the suit commenced by the respondent."
REASONING,"Section 34 of the is in these terms: "" Where any party to an arbitration agreement or any person claiming under him commences any legal proceedings against any other party to the agreement or any person claiming under him in respect of any matter agreed to be referred, any party to such legal proceedings may, at any time before filing a written statement or taking any other steps in the proceedings, apply to the judicial authority before which the proceedings are pending to stay the proceedings; and if satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred in accordance with the arbitration agreement and that the applicant was, at the time when the proceedings were commenced, and still remains, ready and willing to do all things necessary to the proper conduct of the arbitration, such authority may make an order staying the proceedings."
REASONING,""" Thus in order that a stay may be granted under this section, it is necessary that the following conditions should be fulfilled: (1)The proceeding must have been commenced by a party to an arbitration agreement against any other party to the agreement; (2)the legal proceeding which is sought to be."
REASONING,stayed must be in respect of a matter agreed to be referred 867 (3)the applicant for stay must be a party to the legal proceeding and he must have taken no step in the proceeding after appearance.
REASONING,It is also necessary that he should satisfy the Court not only that he is but also was at the commencement of the proceedings ready and willing to do everything necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration; and (4)the Court must be satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to an arbitration in accordance with the arbitration agreement.
REASONING,"The third condition can be taken to have been fulfilled on the facts of the present case, and the fourth is one which is exclusively for the determination of the Court."
REASONING,"The controversy between the parties centres round the other two conditions, namely, conditions (1) and (2) ; and unless the applicant for stay succeeds in establishing that the respondent is a party to an arbitration agreement and that the subject matter of dispute in the suit is a matter coming within the scope of such agreement, it cannot possibly ask the Court to order a stay of the proceedings, under section 34 of the ."
REASONING,The learned Judges of the appellate bench of the High Court have taken the view that the only matter in dispute between the parties to the suit is whether the plaintiff was a party to the contract.
REASONING,"It was definitely alleged by the plaintiff that the contract was not between it and the appellant but was one between the appellant and a third party and since the arbitration agreement is contained in the contract, it is an agreement between those parties only, which could not bind or affect the plaintiff in any way."
REASONING,"The dispute, it is said, which is the subject matter of the suit does not arise under the contract and does not relate to it; it is outside the contract altogether and does not come within the scope of the arbitration agreement."
REASONING,The decision in the appeal therefore rests entirely on the finding of the learned Judges that the matter in dispute between the parties to the suit does not come within the ambit of the arbitration clause.
REASONING,In view of this decision the learned Judges did not consider it necessary to go into the first point as to whether in fact 868 there was a binding arbitration agreement between the parties to the suit.
REASONING,"The learned Chief Justice no doubt did in a manner consider that point also, but he refrained from pronouncing any decision upon it, being of opinion that a decision on this question which was the only issue in the suit itself might prejudice the parties and create a bar of res judicata against one or the other."
REASONING,We think that on the facts of this case it was necessary for the learned Judges of the appellate bench to decide the question as to whether or not the plaintiff in the suit which the applicant wants to stay was a party to the arbitration agreement.
REASONING,This would have a material bearing on the decision of the other question upon which the learned Judges rested their judgments.
REASONING,The first and essential pre requisite to making an order of stay under section 34 of the is that there is a binding arbitration agreement between the parties to the suit which is sought to be stayed.
REASONING,"The question whether the dispute in the suit falls within the arbitration clause really pre supposes that there is such agreement and involves consideration of two matters, viz., (1) what is the dispute in the suit and (2) what disputes the arbitration clause covers?(1)."
REASONING,"The contention raised by the plaintiff in the present suit is, that the contract was really between the appellant and another party and not between it and the appellant and consequently it was not bound by the contract and could not be made liable for any damages in terms thereof."
REASONING,In substance therefore the controversy between the parties in the suit is whether the plaintiff did incur any liability in terms of the contracts evidenced by the two Bought Notes to which it was a signatory no matter in whatever capacity.
REASONING,The question whether the plaintiff was a party to the agreement at all is undoubtedly one which cannot go before the arbitrators and with that question they cannot possibly deal.
PRECEDENT,"But as Lord Porter pointed out in Heyman vs Darwins (2), ""this does not mean that in every instance (1) Vide per Viscount Simon in Heyman vs Darwins, at 360."
PRECEDENT,"(2) , 393."
PRECEDENT,869 in which it is claimed that the arbitrator has no juris diction the Court will refuse to stay an action.
REASONING,"If this were the case such a claim would always defeat an agreement to submit disputes to arbitration, at any rate until the question of jurisdiction had been decided."
REASONING,The Court to which an application for stay is made is put in possession of the facts and arguments and must in such a case make up its mind whether the arbitrator has jurisdiction or not as best it can on the evidence before it.
REASONING,"Indeed, the application for stay gives an opportunity for putting these and other considerations before the court that it may determine whether the action shall be stayed or not."
REASONING,""" Section 34 of the as is well known is a virtual reproduction of section 4 of the English of 1889."
PRECEDENT,"The observations quoted above were approved of by Mr. Justice section R. Das in the case of Khusiram V. Hanutmal (1) and it was held by the learned Judge that where on an application made under section 34 of the for stay of a suit, an issue is raised as to the formation, existence or validity of the con."
REASONING,"tract containing the arbitration clause, the Court is not bound to refuse a stay but may in its discretion, on the application for stay, decide the issue as to the existence or validity of the arbitration agreement even though it may involve incidentally a decision as to the validity or existence of the parent contract."
REASONING,We are in entire agreement with the view enunciated above.
REASONING,"As we have said already, it is incumbent upon the Court when invited to stay a suit under section 34 of the to decide first of all whether there is a binding agreement for arbitration between the parties to the suit."
REASONING,"So far as the present case is concerned if it is held that the arbitration agreement and the contract containing it were between the parties to the suit, the dispute in the present suit would be one relating to the rights and liabilities of the parties on the basis of the contract itself and would come within the purview of the arbitration clause worded as it is in the widest of terms, in accordance with the principle enunciated by this Court in A. M. Nair and (1) at 518."
PRECEDENT,870 Company vs Gordhandass (1).
REASONING,"If on the other hand it is held that the plaintiff was not a party to the agreement, the application for stay must necessarily be dismissed."
PRECEDENT,The appellate Judges of the High Court in our opinion held rightly that the decision in A. M. Mair and Company vs Gordhandass (1) was not in any sense conclusive in the present case on the question of the dispute in the suit being included in the arbitration agreement.
REASONING,The report shows that the dispute in that case was whether the appellants had made the contract in their own right as principals or on behalf of the Bengal Jute Mill Company as agents of the latter.
REASONING,The decision of this question was held to turn upon a true construction of the contract and consequently it was a dispute under or arising out of or concerning the contract.
REASONING,"The judgment proceeds on the footing that there was in fact a contract between the parties and the only dispute was in which character they were parties to it, the respondents contending that the appellants were not bound as principals while the latter said that they were."
REASONING,Mr. Justice Fazl Ali in delivering the judgment pointed out that the error into which the learned Judges of the appellate bench of the High Court appeared to have fallen was their regarding the dispute raised by the respondent in respect of the position of the appellants under the contract as having the same consequence as a dispute as to the contract never having been entered into.
REASONING,In this case it is certainly not admitted that the respondent was a party to the contract.
REASONING,In fact that is the subject matter of controversy in the suit itself.
REASONING,"But, as has been said already, the question having been raised , in this application, under section 34 of the , the Court has undoubted jurisdiction to decide it for the purpose of finding as to whether or not there is a binding arbitration agreement between the, parties to the suit."
REASONING,"It has been said by Chakravartti C.J. and in our opinion rightly, that if the person whose concern with the agreement is in question is a signatory to,the contract and formally a (1) ; 871 contracting party, that will be sufficient to enable the Court to hold for purposes of section 34 that he is a party to the agreement."
REASONING,It was the contention of the respondent in the Court below that this test was not fulfilled in the present case.
REASONING,"The point has been canvassed before us also by Mr. Sen and it has been argued on the authority of several decided cases that in cases of this description the Bought Note is a mere intimation to the buyer, that the orders of the latter have been carried out and purchases have been made from other persons and not from them."
REASONING,The writer does not thereby become a party to the contract of purchase and sale even as an agent.
REASONING,He remains a mere broker or intermediary and the provision of section 230(2) of the Contract Act 'Cannot be invoked against him.
REASONING,"Mr. Khaitan on the other hand argues that the English law being quite different from the Indian law regarding the liability of an agent contracting on behalf of an undisclosed principal, the English authorities are no guide to a solution of the problem."
REASONING,"It is said that the case of Patiram Banerjee vs Kanknarrah Co., Ltd.(1), upon which the respondent relies, was wrongly decided being based upon English authorities which have no application to India."
REASONING,"The respondent here, it is pointed out, signed an elaborate document setting out in full every particular of the contract entered into and it is impossible to say that he was not an agent executing a contract on behalf of another whose identity he did not disclose but was a mere intermediary conveying an information to the buyer."
REASONING,"In our opinion, the point is not free from doubt and requires careful consideration and as it was not decided by the learned Judges of the High Court and we have not the advantage of having their views upon it, the proper course for us to follow would be to send the case back for a hearing of and decision on this point."
REASONING,"We, therefore, allow the appeal and set aside the judgments of both the Courts below."
REASONING,The matter will go back to the appellate bench of the Calcutta High Court which will decide as an issue in the proceeding under section 34 of the the question whether the respondent was or was not a party (1) Cal.

RPC,The appellant will have its costs of this appeal.

FACTS,This is a defendant 's appeal in a suit for contribution brought by the son of a mortgagor against the co mortgagors.
FACTS,The parties are related as below : Balai Lall Seal (died1917) I Megharnala Dassi (died 1945) I I I I I Bejoy Lall Biswa Lall Tarak Lall Kedar Lall NakuLall (D. 23 5 33) (D.

FACTS,"The mortgage was exe cuted on the 12th June, 1936, in favour of one Mst."
FACTS,"Gyarsi for a consideration of Rs. 80,000."
FACTS,For convenience I will call this the suit mortgage though this is not a suit on the mortgage.
FACTS,"The mortgagee sued in the year 1938 and obtained a preliminary decree for sale on the 17th of February, 1939, for a sum of Rs. 89,485 12 9 plus costs."
FACTS,"The decree was made final on the 22nd of December, 1989."
FACTS,"In execution the mortgagee proceeded against the proper ty of the plaintiff alone (as Tarak 's son) and, during the pendency of the execution, assigned her rights in the decree to the Hooghly Flour Mills."
FACTS,"The Mills continued the execu tion and on the 11th of March, 1943, the claim was satisfied in this way."
FACTS,"An order of the Court was obtained sanctioning sale of a part of the mortgaged property, 20 Round Tank Lane (which belonged exclusively to the plaintiff), to the decree holder for a sum of Rs. 1,50,000."
FACTS,It was directed that the consid eration should first be applied in payment of the claim and costs and that the decreeholder should execute a reconvey ance of the rest of the mortgaged properties in favour of the mortgagors.
FACTS,The sanction of the Court was necessary because the judgment debtor Hari Lall (present plaintiff) was a minor.
FACTS,"181 This was done and 20, Round Tank Lane, was conveyed by the present plaintiff to the Hooghly Flour Mills on the 18th of March, 1943."
FACTS,"Out of the consideration a sum of Rs. 97,116 11 0 was paid to the Mills in lull satisfaction of the claim and costs then outstanding."
FACTS,The Mills executed a reconveyance of the rest of the properties to the mortgagors in release of the mortgage on the same day.
FACTS,"In addition to this Rs. 97, 116 11 0, further sums of Rs. 14,400 and Rs. 8,100 had also been paid before the dates of these transactions."
FACTS,These sums were paid by a Receiver who had been appointed by the Court pendente lite.
FACTS,"These sums came out of the rents which the Receiver obtained from the plaintiff 's property, 20 Round Tank Lane."
FACTS,"The plaintiff says that in this way he paid a total of Rs. 1,19,116 11 0 in satisfaction of the mortgage."
FACTS,"His one third share in this comes to Rs. 39,872 3 8."
FACTS,"He claims that he is entitled to receive the balance of Rs. 79,744 7 4 from the two defendants and that each of them is liable for a half of that sum namely, Rs. 39,872 3 8."
FACTS,"In addition to this the plaintiff had incurred costs amounting to Rs. 1,144 8 6 in resisting Mst."
FACTS,Gyarsi 's claim and in connection with the reconveyance.
FACTS,"He also claims one third of this sum, namely Rs. 381 8 2, from each of the defendants."
FACTS,"The total claim against each defendant accord ingly comes to Rs. 40,253 11 10."
FACTS,"In addition to this the plaintiff asked for (1) ""a declaration that the properties mentioned in Schedule 'A '. belonging to the defendants stand charged with the repayment of the sum of Rs. 80,507 7 8 being the aggregate amount due and payable by the two defendants,"" and (2) ""Decree under Order XXXIV of the Civil Procedure Code in proper form."" Schedule A contains a list of the rest of the mortgaged properties which belong exclusively to the defendants, 24 182 It will be seen that the plaintiff claims on the basis that each of the three mortgagors is liable to contribute in equal shares towards payment of the mortgage debt."
FACTS,The defendants did not deny their liability to contribute.
FACTS,They only challenged the basis on which it was to be comput ed.
FACTS,"They ,pleaded a special agreement between Tarak Lal and themselves under which their liabilities were to be calcu lated in the following way."
FACTS,"According to them, the bulk of the Rs. 80,000 was borrowed on what I have called the suit mortgage to pay off previous debts which had been incurred by the parties on earlier mortgages."
FACTS,"The amount which went towards satisfaction of the defendant 's portion of these earlier liabilities was only Rs. 13,259 2 4."
FACTS,"Therefore, the only benefit they got out of this Rs. 80,000 was to that extent."
FACTS,"The plaintiff 's father Tarak on the other hand benefitted to the extent of Rs. 53,481 11 4."
FACTS,They therefore agreed at the date of the suit mortgage that their respec tive liabilities as between themselves should be proportion ate to the benefit derived by each as above.
RLC,On appeal the learned Chief Justice of the High Court and Chatterjee J. disagreed and held that it was not.
REASONING,"As I agree with the learned appellate Judges for reasons which I shall give hereafter, it will be necessary to set out the further facts."
REASONING,But I need not do so in any detail as they are given in full in the two judgments of the High Court.
REASONING,We are only concerned here with the question of principle; so it will be more convenient to reduce the problem to its simplest terms.
REASONING,"We are concerned here with four items of property which I shall term Chittaranjan Avenue, Strand Road, No. 16 Round Tank Lane and 20 Round Tank Lane."
REASONING,"These properties were originally joint family properties, but in the year 1932 there was a partition which was compelled by reason of a suit filed by Tarak 183 against his brothers and mother."
REASONING,"The upshot was that the properties were divided as follows: (1) Bejoy, Kedar, Naku and the mother Meghamala obtained Chittaranj an Avenue."
REASONING,(2) Tarak (plaintiff 's father) obtained 16 Round Tank Lane and 20 Round Tank Lane.
REASONING,"(3) Kedar, Naku and Biswa Lall obtained Strand Road."
REASONING,"Before this partition there were three mortgages: The first of these was executed on the 16th of June, 1925."
REASONING,"All five brothers joined in it and they mortgaged the Strand Road property for Rs. 10,000."
REASONING,This was in favour of Bhuvan Chandra Bhur.
REASONING,"The second was on the 11th of October, 1926."
REASONING,"In this Bejoy and Tarak mortgaged their 2/5 share in Chittaranjan, Strand, Dum Dum and 20 Round Tank Lane for Rs. 5,000."
REASONING,The mortgagee was Binode Behari Sen.
REASONING,"The third was on the 28th January, 1927."
REASONING,"In this Bejoy and Tarak again mortgaged their 2/5 share in the same items of property for Rs. 7,000 to Binode Behari Sen and Kunja Behari Sen."
REASONING,"All three sets of mortgagees, or their representatives, instituted suits on their respective mortgages and obtained final decrees Bejoy died on the 23rd of May, 1933, leaving a son Jugal."
REASONING,"On the 12th of June, 1936, came what I have called the suit mortgage executed by the three brothers,Tarak, Kedar and Naku, for Rs. 80,000."
REASONING,The properties mortgaged were (1) the shares of Kedar and Naku in Chittaranjan Avenue and 16 Round Tank Lane; (2) 20 Round Tank Lane which had been allotted to Tarak; (3) the reversionary interest of all three in the share allotted to the mother.
REASONING,"The consideration of Rs. 80,000 was expended as follows:Rs."
REASONING,"29,667 10 0 was paid by Tarak, Kedar and Naku in satisfaction of the first mortgage and the 184 later decretal charge; Rs. 11,519 11 0 in satisfaction of the second and Rs. 13,502 14 0 in satisfaction of the third."
REASONING,"The balance of Rs. 25,310 is alleged by the appellants to have been retained by Tarak."
REASONING,I have taken these figures from the judgments of the High Court.
REASONING,"I understand some of the details are disputed, so I make it clear that I am not setting out the decision of this Court regarding the de tails but only giving an overall picture."
REASONING,"Shorn of overburdening detail the problem, reduced to its simplest terms, comes to this."
REASONING,"Three persons A, B and C separately own properties of unequal value, Blackman, Whiteacre and Greenacre."
REASONING,"Let us assume that their values at the material date are Rs. 30,000, Rs. 20,000 and Rs. 10,000 respectively."
REASONING,"A, B and C, acting in various combinations from time to time, incur debts."
REASONING,It matters not for present purposes whether those debts are secured on these properties or not because a time must come when their separate liabilities as amongst themselves have to be ascertained and apportioned.
REASONING,"Let us assume that when that is done, A 's responsibility extends to Rs. 2,000, B 's to Rs. 3,000 and C 's to Rs. 5,000."
REASONING,"In order to clear off these debts, A, B and C jointly mortgage their three estates for Rs. 10,000, the total aggregate sum due at the date of the mortgage from the three of them."
REASONING,"There is no contract between them, either in the mortgage deed or otherwise, regarding their respective shares of responsibility in the Rs. 10,000."
REASONING,"At the date of redemption the mortgage debt has swollen to Rs. 15,000."
REASONING,"A alone redeems by selling Blackacre, which is his separate estate, to the mortgagee for Rs. 35,000 that being the value of Blackacre at the date of redemption."
REASONING,"Rs. 15,000 of this is applied in satisfaction of the mortgage debt and the balance of Rs. 20,000 is retained by A."
REASONING,What are A 's rights as against B and C ? Three solutions readily suggest themselves.
REASONING,One is that the three contribute equally.
REASONING,"In that event B would pay A Rs. 5,000 and C would pay Rs. 5,000."
REASONING,185 A second solution is that they pay in proportion to the extent of the benefits derived.
REASONING,"In that event B 's share would be 3/10 of Rs. 15,000, that is to say, Rs. 4,500."
REASONING,"and C 's would be 5/10 of Rs. 15,000, that is Rs. 7,500."
REASONING,A third solution is that they pay proportionately to the values of the properties mortgaged.
REASONING,"In that event B would have to pay 2/6 of Rs. 15,000, that is Rs. 5,000, and C 1/6 of Rs. 15,000 ' which come to Rs, 2,500."
REASONING,The problem is to know which of these three solutions to apply.
REASONING,"In the absence of other considerations, the most equitable solution is obviously the second."
REASONING,But the matter is not as simple as that.
REASONING,There are certain statutory provi sions which must first be examined.
ARG,The learned counsel for the plaintiff respondent con tended that section 43 of the Contract Act applied.
ARG,"He relied on the following provision : ""Each of two or more joint promisors may compel every other joint promisor to contribute equally with himself to the performance of the promise, unless a contrary intention appears from the contract."
ARG,"If any one of two or more joint promisors makes default in such contribution, the remaining joint promisors must bear the loss arising from such default in equal shares."
ARG,""" The argument is that unless a contrary intention appears from ""the contract"" the."
ARG,loss must be borne equally.
ARG,"It was contended, and with that I agree, that the words ""the con tract"" can only refer to the main contract between the promisors on the one side and the promisee on the other."
ARG,That contract in this case is the suit mortgage.
REASONING,"There is no contract to the contrary in the document, therefore, it was contended, the section must apply."
REASONING,"That of course would be the clear, logical and simple conclusion ii there were no other provision of law to consider."
REASONING,But we are dealing here with a mortgage and so we have also to look to the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act.
REASONING,"186 Incidentally, if this argument is pushed to its logical conclusion it would exclude any collateral or subsequent agreement between the promisors inter se which does not appear in the main contract."
REASONING,But we need not enter into that here.
REASONING,The sections of the Transfer of Property Act which concern us are 82 and 92.
REASONING,The first confers a right of contribution.
REASONING,The second a right of subrogation.
REASONING,I will consider section 82 first.
REASONING,"It runs : ""Where property subject to a mortgage belongs to two or more persons having distinct and separate rights of owner ship therein, the different shares in or parts of such property owned by such persons are, in the absence of a contract to the contrary, liable to contribute rateably to the debt secured by the mortgage . . "" That is the position here."
REASONING,Next I turn to section 92.
REASONING,"That runs "" . any co mortgagor shall, on redeeming property subject to the mortgage, have, so far as regards redemption, foreclosure or sale of such property, the same rights as the mortgagee whose mortgage he redeems may have against the mortgagor . "" That also applies."
REASONING,"Now these provisions at once raise a competition between sections 82 and 92 of the Transfer of Property Act, section 43 of the Contract Act and what I might term the principle of beneficial, as opposed to proportionate or equal, distri bution of liability."
REASONING,"I am of opinion that the second solution adumbrated earlier in this judgment, based on equities, must be ruled out at once."
REASONING,These matters have been dealt with by statute and we are now only concerned with statutory rights and cannot in the face of the statutory provisions have recourse to equitable principles however fair they may appear to be at first sight.
PRECEDENT,The Privy Council pointed out in Rani Chhatra Kumari vs Mohan Bikram (1) that the doctrine of the (1) Pat. 851 at 869.
PRECEDENT,187 equitable estate has no application in India.
PRECEDENT,"So also refer ring to the right of redemption their Lordships held in Mohammad Sher Khan vs Seth Swami Dayal(1) that the right is now governed by statute, namely section 60, Transfer of Property Act."
PRECEDENT,Sulaiman c.
PRECEDENT,"J. (later a Judge of the Federal Court) ruled Court equitable considerations in the Allahabad High Court in matters of subrogation under sections 91, 92, 101 and 105, Transfer of Property Act, in Hira Singh vs Jai Singh(2) and so did Stone C.J. and I in the Nagpur High Court in Taibai vs Wasudeorao (3)."
PRECEDENT,In the ease of section 82 the Privy Council held in Ganesh Lal vs Charan Singh(4) that that section prescribes the conditions in which contribution is payable and that it is not proper to introduce into the matter any extrinsic principle to modify the statutory provisions.
REASONING,"So, both on authority and principle the deci sion must rest solely on whatever section is held to apply."
REASONING,"So far as section 43 is concerned, I am not prepared to apply it unless sections 82 and 92 can be excluded."
REASONING,Both sections 43 and 82 deal with the question of contribution.
REASONING,Section 43 is a provision of the Contract Act dealing with contracts generally.
REASONING,Section 82 applies to mortgages.
REASONING,"As the right to contribution here arises out of a mortgage, I am clear that section 82 must exclude section 43 because when there is a general law and a special law dealing with a particular matter, the special excludes the general."
REASONING,"In my opinion, the whole law of mortgage in India, including the law of contribution arising out of a transaction of mort gage, is now statutory and is embodied in the Transfer of Property Act read with the Civil Procedure Code."
REASONING,I am clear we cannot travel beyond these statutory provisions.
REASONING,"Now, when parties enter into a mortgage they know, or must be taken to know, that the law of mortgage provides for this very question of contribution."
REASONING,"It confers rights on the mortgagor who redeems and directs that, in the absence of a contract to the contrary, he (1) (1922) 49 I.A. 60 at Nag. 206 at 216."
REASONING,188 shall be reimbursed in a particular way out of particular properties.
REASONING,"The parties are at liberty to vary these rights and liabilities by special contract to the contrary but if they do not do so, I can see no reason why these provisions should be abrogated in favour of a section in the Contract Act which does not deal with mortgages."
REASONING,"Slightly to vary the language of the Judicial Committee it is the terms and nature of the transaction viewed in the light of the law of mortgage in India which exclude the personal liability and therefore section 43, except where there is a contract to the contrary."
REASONING,It was suggested that the rule is inequitable and will operate harshly in cases like the present.
REASONING,But the remedy lies in the parties ' own hands.
REASONING,It is open to them to make a contract to the contrary.
REASONING,"If they do not, then the law steps in and makes statutory rules to which effect must be given."
REASONING,It is not for judges to consider whether that is the best possible solution but the rule at any rate obviates the necessity of roving enquiries into the objects of a borrow ing and the application of the funds.
REASONING,On an overall basis it is perhaps as good as any other.
REASONING,But that hardly matters.
REASONING,The rule is there and full effect must be given to it.
ARG,The learned counsel for the plaintiff respondent urged that the defendants are shut out from relying on section 82 because that was not their case and the question was never raised by them in the High Court.
REASONING,Such reference as there is to the section was with reference to an argument urged on behalf of the plaintiff.
REASONING,I am not impressed with this objection.
REASONING,", On the facts set out by the plaintiff it is evident that he is entitled to contribution."
REASONING,The method of computation is a matter of law and it is for the judges to apply the law to the facts stated and give the plaintiff such relief as is appropriate to the case.
REASONING,"I turn now to the question of fact, the special agree ment pleaded by the defendants."
REASONING,The only evidence in sup port of it is that of the first defendant Kedar.
REASONING,"According to him, the agreement was an oral one 189 though the parties contemplated writing and registration."
REASONING,His explanation for lack of any writing is this.
REASONING,"He was asked whether anything was put down in writing and he re plied : ""No, nothing was done then, but there was an understand ing that it would be done but Tarak went away to Darjeeling and when he came back he died soon after he came back and nothing could be done in writing."
REASONING,""" Later, he was asked ""Therefore, you, contemplated that there would be a document which would have to be registered in connection with the adjustment ?"" and he replied ' 'Yes""."
REASONING,"He also tells us that the parties regarded the matter as confidential and so only three per sons were present, Tarak, Naku and himself."
REASONING,"It is to be observed that Naku, who is the second defendant, has not entered the box."
REASONING,"Stopping there, it is evident that we have to rely on the memory of a very interested person speaking nearly thirteen years after the event about a transaction affecting some Rs. 80,000."
REASONING,Nor is it the memory of some simple event which might well have fixed itself in his mind.
REASONING,The question whether and at what stage parties reach finality when writ ing is in contemplation is a difficult and complex one involving delicate considerations of much nicety even when the preliminaries are all in writing.
REASONING,"The turn of a phrase here, the use of a word there, may make a world of differ ence."
PRECEDENT,The law regarding this was examined by me at some length in the Nagpur High Court in Shamjibhai vs Jagoo Hernchand Shah (1).
REASONING,How much greater are the difficulties when we do not know the exact words the parties used and have to delve into the mind of a dead man (Tarak) through the impressions of an interested witness given some thirteen years after the event.
REASONING,"I find it difficult to accept this version and consider it would be dangerous to do so, particularly when the (1) I.L.R. at 586 588, and 598 25 190 witness is a hesitant and reluctant one, as his examination discloses, and even evasive on some points; also when the defendants have deliberately withheld from the Court assist ance which it was in their power to render I refer to the absence of Naku, the only other person present, from the box."
REASONING,I am unable to accept this testimony.
REASONING,Nor is this the only point.
REASONING,"Despite the insistence of the witness that the parties were on good terms and trusted each other, the fact remains that Tarak found it necessary to institute a suit for partition against his brothers and fight it to a finish."
REASONING,They were not able to arrange matters amicably.
REASONING,"it was suggested in argument that was probably because of creditors who could not be persuaded to agree and it was pointed out that creditors were joined in the suit, but that is not wholly convincing particularly when it is admitted that Tarak was insisting on writing and regis tration."
REASONING,"It is evident that he, at any rate, was not prepared to leave matters as they were and trust to the good faith of his brothers."
REASONING,Now we know that Tarak was in Calcutta about three months after the date of the alleged agreement.
REASONING,"We also know that Kedar was most anxious to have such an agreement, for he tells us so."
REASONING,He tells us further that there was before them a rough draft of the terms.
REASONING,That document was produced in Court.
REASONING,But the draft was neither signed nor initialled.
REASONING,The only inference I can draw from these facts is that Tarak either refused to agree or had not made up his mind.
REASONING,"The figures put forward by the defendants were contested on behalf of the plaintiff and we were given an alternative set of figures which in turn were contested by the other side, but they were enough to show that the matter is not as straightforward or as simple as the defendants would have us believe."
REASONING,"Therefore, Tarak 's inaction during the three months and the omission of either side to initial the draft point clearly, at the lowest, to hesitancy on Tarak 's part."
REASONING,It may be he wanted his lawyers to examine his position or it may be he refused to have anything to do with it.
REASONING,"191 It is just possible that there were negotiations, but on those broad facts I am not prepared to believe the witness when he tells us, or rather suggests, that the parties reached finality."
REASONING,It would in any event be dangerous to believe a witness in circumstances like this.
REASONING,But when the defendants deliberately withheld from the Court that assist ance which is its due I can only conclude that their case was too shaky to stand further proving.
REASONING,On these broad grounds alone I would hold that the agreement is not proved.
REASONING,Much was made in argument about the rule regarding the weight to be given to the estimate of the judge who saw and heard a witness.
PRECEDENT,I do not doubt the soundness of the rule but it can be pushed too far as their Lordships of the Judicial Committee pointed out in Virappa vs Periakaruppan(1).
REASONING,"In the present case, the learned Judge who tried the case believed Kedar not because of his demea nour but because the learned Judge considered that his story was inherently probable."
REASONING,"That, however, is a matter which the learned appellate Judges were in as good a position to appreciate as the learned trial Judge."
REASONING,"If probability is to be the test, then the conduct of Tarak suggests that it is very improbable that he could have agreed."
REASONING,That leaves at large the nature of the relief to which the plaintiff is entitled.
REASONING,"In the view I take, there being no contract to the contrary, the plaintiff 's only remedy is under section 92 of the Transfer of Property Act read with section 82."
REASONING,"The question is, has his suit been so framed ? The plaintiff has claimed separate personal reliefs against the defendants."
REASONING,"As there is no personal covenant as between the mortgagors or any ""contract to the contrary"", that relief ' cannot be granted."
REASONING,"The plaintiff has also asked for a declaration of charge and for a decree under Order XXXIV, Civil Procedure Code."
REASONING,"The declaration of charge standing by itself is superfluous although Order XXXIV, rule 2 (1) does require that the decree in a mortgage suit shall (1) A.I.R. 1945 P.C. 35 at 37."
REASONING,"192 ""declare the amount so due"" at the date of the decree."
REASONING,"But reading the two reliefs together, I am of opinion that though the claim is inartistically worded the plaintiff has in substance asked for a mortgage decree up to a limit of Rs. 40,253 11 10 with interest against each defendant."
REASONING,No other kind of decree could be given under Order XXXIV.
REASONING,"Therefore, though he has not used the word ""subrogation"" he has asked in substance for the relief to which a subrogee would be entitled under the Transfer of Property Act."
REASONING,"I would be slow to throw out a claim on a mere techni cality of pleading when the substance of the thing is there and no prejudice is caused to the other side, however clum sily or inartistically the plaint may be worded."
REASONING,"In any event, it is always open to a court to give a plaintiff such general or other relief as it deems just to the same extent as if it had been asked for, provided that occasions no prejudice to the other side beyond what can be compensated for in costs."
REASONING,"In the circumstances, in the absence of agreement be tween the parties as to the figures, I would remand this case to the High Court for (1) an enquiry regarding the sum paid by the plaintiff 's father for satisfaction of the mortgage dated the 12th June, 1936, (2) for the interest due on that sum at the contract rate in the mortgage from the date of payment to the date of decree, (a) lot the values of the various properties mortgaged at the date of the mort gage."
REASONING,"When the figures are ascertained, I would direct that the liability of each defendant be ascertained separately in the manner prescribed by section 82, Transfer of Property Act."
REASONING,"the event of this liability exceeding Rs. 40,253 11 10 with interest against either defendant, I would direct that his liability be reduced to Rs. 40,253 11 10 plus interest."
REASONING,"When these figures are ascertained, I would direct that a mortgage decree for sale be drawn up in the usual way affording either defendant the right to redeem the whole of the balance of the property 193 (excluding the plaintiff 's) for the aggregate sum due as above and, in default of payment, limiting the liabilities of each item of property to the sum rateably due on it under section 82."
REASONING,On the question of costs.
REASONING,"The plaintiff repudiated section 82 in the course of the arguments before us and rested his case on section 43 of the Contract Act, nor did he clearly and unmistakably plead a case of subrogation in his plaint even in the alternative."
REASONING,"The defendants, on the other hand, set up a case which has failed on the facts."
REASONING,"I would, therefore, direct each side to bear its own costs in this appeal."
REASONING,"As regards the costs incurred in the Courts below and any costs which may be necessitated by a further enquiry, they will be determined according to the final result of the litigation and with due regard to all matters bearing on the question of costs."
RPC,FAZL ALI J.
RPC,I agree.

JUDGE,The Judgment of the Court was deliv ered by PATANJALI SASTRI C.J.
FACTS,"This is a petition under article 32 of the Constitution submitted through the Super intendent, Central Jail, Ambala, for the issue of a writ of habeas corpus for the release of the petitioner from custo dy."
FACTS,"On 5th July, 1950, the petitioner was arrested and detained under an order of the District Magistrate of Amrit sar in exercise of the powers conferred on him under section 3 of the , and the grounds of his detention were served on him as required by section 7 of the Act on 10th July, 1950."
FACTS,"The Act having been amended by the Preventive Detention (Amendment) Act, 1951, with effect from 22nd February, 1951, a fresh order No. 7853 ADSB, dated 17th May, 1951, was issued in the following terms : ""Whereas the Governor of Punjab is satisfied with re spect to the person known as Naranjan Singh Nathawan, s/o Lehna Singh of village Chak Sikandar, 397 P.S. Ramdas, Amritsar District, that with a view to prevent ing him from acting in a manner prejudicial to the security of the State, it is necessary to make the following order: Now, therefore."
FACTS,"in exercise of the powers conferred by sub section (1) of section 3 and section 4 of the Preven tive Detention Act, 1950, as amended by the Preventive Detention (Amendment) Act, 1951, the Governor of Punjab hereby directs that the said Naranjan Singh Nathawan be committed to the custody of the Inspector General of Pris ons, Punjab, and detained in any jail of the State till 31st March, 1952, subject to such conditions as to maintenance, discipline and punishment for breaches of discipline as have been specified by general order or as contained in the Punjab Detenu Rules, 1950."
FACTS,""" This order was served on the petitioner on 23rd May, 1951, but no grounds in support of this order were served on him."
FACTS,"The petitioner thereupon presented this petition for his release contending that the aforesaid order was illegal inasmuch as (1) the grounds of detention communicated to him on 10th July, 1950, were ""quite vague, false and imaginary"" and (2) he was not furnished with the grounds on which the order dated 17th May, 1951, was based."
FACTS,"The petition was heard ex parte on 12th November, 1951, when this Court issued a rule nisi calling upon the respondent to show cause why the petitioner should not be released, and it was posted for final hearing on 23rd November, 1951."
FACTS,"Meanwhile, the State Government issued an order on 18th November, 1951."
FACTS,"revoking the order of detention dated 17th May, 1951, and on the same date the District Magistrate, Amritsar, issued yet another order for the detention of the petitioner under sections a and 4 of the amended Act; this last order along with the grounds on which it was based was served on the petitioner on 19th November, 1951."
FACTS,"Thereupon the petitioner submitted a supplemental peti tion to this Court on 28th November, 1951, challenging the validity of the last order on the ground 398 that ""it was only a device to defeat the habeas corpus petition of the petitioner in which a rule had already been issued , and he put forward an additional ground of attack on the legality of the earlier order dated 17th may, 1951, namely, that it fixed the term of detention till 31st March, 1952, before obtaining the opinion of the Advisory Board as required by section 11 of the amended Act."
FACTS,This ground was evidently based on the view expressed by this Court that the specification of the period of detention in the initial order of detention under section 3 of the amended Act before obtaining the opinion of the Advisory Board rendered the order illegal.
FACTS,"In the return to the rule showing cause filed on behalf of the respondent, the Under Secretary (Home) to the Govern ment explained the circumstances which led to the issue of the fresh order of detention dated 18th November, 1951."
FACTS,"After stating that the petitioner 's case was referred to and considered by the Advisory Board constituted under section 8 of the amended Act and that the Board reported on 30th May, 1951, that there was sufficient cause for the detention of the petitioner, the affidavit proceeded as follows: ""That the Government was advised that the orders made under section 11 of the , as amended by the Preventive Detention (Amendment) Act, 1951, but carried out in the form of orders under section 3 of the said Act, should be followed by grounds of detention and, as this had not been done in most cases, the detentions were likely to be called in question."
FACTS,The Government was further advised there were other technical defects which might render the detention of various detenus untenable.
FACTS,"In view of this, the Government decided that the cases of all dete nus should be reviewed by the District Magistrates con cerned."
FACTS,"Accordingly, the Punjab Government instructed the District Magistrates to review the cases and apply their minds afresh and emphasised that there must exist rational grounds with the detaining authority to justify the deten tion of a person and they were asked to report clearly in each case if the District 399 Magistrate concerned wanted the detenus to be detained."
FACTS,The Punjab Government also reviewed some cases.
FACTS,"Accordingly all cases including the case of the petitioner were reviewed and in this case the District Magistrate was again satisfied that it was necessary that the detenu be detained with a view to prevent him from acting in a manner prejudicial to the security of the State and the maintenance of public order."" And it concluded by stating ""that the petitioner is detained now under the orders of the District Magistrate, Amritsar."
FACTS,""" The original and supplementary petitions came on in due course for hearing before Fazl Ali and Vivian Bose JJ."
PRECEDENT,"on 17th December, 1951, when reliance was placed on behalf of t he petitioner on certain observations in an unreported decision of this Court in Petition No. 334 of 1951 (Naranjan Singh vs The State of Punjab) and it was claimed that in view of those observations and of the provisions of Part III of the Constitution, the decision in Basant Chandra Ghose vs King Emperor(1), on which the respondent relied."
FACTS,was no longer good law.
REASONING,The learned Judges thought that the matter should be considered by a Constitution bench and the case was accordingly placed before us.
REASONING,"It will be seen from the affidavit filed on behalf of the respondent that the case of the petitioner, along with his representation against the detention order of 17th May, 1951, was placed before the Advisory Board for its consider ation, and the Board reported on 30th May, 1951, that in its opinion there was sufficient cause for the detention of the petitioner."
REASONING,"It is said that, on the basis of that report, the Government decided that the petitioner should be de tained till 31st March, 1952, but while a properly framed order under section 11 should ""confirm"" the detention order and ""continue"" the detention for a specified period, the order of 17th May, 1951, was issued under a misapprehension in the form of an initial order under section 3 of the amended Act."
REASONING,on the same grounds as before without any fresh communication thereof to the petitioner.
REASONING,"To (1) 52 400 avoid arguments based on possible defects of a technical and formal character, the said order was revoked under section 13, and on a review of the case by the District Magistrate, a fresh order of detention was issued under section 3 on 18th November, 1951, and this was followed by a formal communication of the same grounds as before as there could be no fresh grounds, the petitioner having throughout been under detention."
REASONING,It is contended by the Advocate General of the Punjab that the decision reported in is clear authority in support of the validity of the aforesaid order.
REASONING,On essentially similar facts the court laid down two propo sitions both of which have application here.
REASONING,"(1) Where an earlier order of detention is defective merely on formal grounds, there is nothing to preclude a proper order of detention being based on the pre existing grounds them selves, especially in cases in which the sufficiency of the grounds is not examinable by the courts, and (2) if at any time before the court directs the release of the detenu, a valid order directing his detention is produced, the court cannot direct his release merely on the ground that at some prior stage there was no valid cause for detention."
REASONING,The question is not whether the later order validates the earli er detention but whether in the face of the later valid order the court can direct the release of the petitioner.
REASONING,The learned Judges point out that the analogy of civil proceedings in which the rights of parties have ordinarily to be ascertained as on the date of the institution of the proceedings has no application to proceedings in the nature of habeas corpus where the court is concerned solely with the question whether the applicant is being lawfully de tained or not.
REASONING,"The petitioner 's learned counsel conceded that he could not challenge the correctness of the second proposition, but took exception to the first as being no longer tenable after the Indian Constitution came into force."
REASONING,"It was urged that article 22 lays down the procedure to be followed in cases of preventive detention and the said procedure must be strictly observed 401 as the only prospect of release by a court must be on the basis of technical or formal defects, a long line of deci sions having held that the scope of judicial review in matters of preventive detention is practically limited to an enquiry as to whether there has been strict compliance with the requirements of the law."
PRECEDENT,"This is undoubtedly true and this Court had occasion in the recent case of Makhan Singh Tarsikka vs The State of Punjab (Petition No. 308 of 1951)(1) to observe ""it cannot too often be emphasised that before a person is deprived of his personal liberty the procedure established by law must be strictly followed and must not be departed from to the disadvantage of the person affected""."
REASONING,"This proposition, however, applied with equal force to cases of preventive detention before the commence ment of the Constitution, and it is difficult to see what difference the Constitution makes in regard to the position."
REASONING,"Indeed, the position is now made more clear by the express provisions of section 13 of the Act which provides that a detention order may at any time be revoked or modified and that such revocation shall not bar the making of a fresh detention order under section 3 against the same person."
REASONING,"Once it is conceded that in habeas corpus proceedings the court is to have regard to the legality or otherwise of the detention at the time of the return and not with reference to the date of the institution of the proceeding, it is difficult to hold, in the absence of proof of bad faith, that the detaining authority cannot supersede an earlier order of detention challenged as illegal and make a fresh order wherever possible which is free from defects and duly complies with the requirements of the law in that behalf."
REASONING,"As regards the observations in Naranjan Singh 's case, we do not understand them as laying down any general proposi tion to the effect that no fresh order of detention could be made when once a petition challenging the validity of an earlier order has been filed in court."
REASONING,"The learned Judges appear to have inferred from the facts of that case that the later order was (1) Since reported as ; 402 not made bona fide on being satisfied that the petitioner 's detention was still necessary but it was ""obviously to defeat the present petition""."
REASONING,"The question of bad faith, if raised would certainly have to be decided with reference to the circumstances of each case, but the observations in one case cannot be regarded as a precedent in dealing with other cases."
RPC,We accordingly remit the case for further hearing.
RPC,This order will govern the other petitions where the same ques tion was raised.
RPC,Petitions remitted.

JUDGE,The Judgment of the Court was deliv ered by BOSE J.
FACTS,This is a defendant 's appeal in a suit on two mortgages.
FACTS,"The first was executed on the 7th of April, 1931, by the defendant and his father."
FACTS,"The second was dated the 17th of December, 1935, and was executed by the defend ant alone."
FACTS,"The first was for a sum of Rs, 9,500, the second for Rs. 3,500."
FACTS,The same property was mortgaged each time.
FACTS,"The claim on the two deeds together was for Rs. 20,774 3 0."
FACTS,These mortgages were in favour of one Narayan Gopal Sathe.
FACTS,"On the 28th of March, 1940, the mortgagee assigned them both to the plaintiff who now sues on them."
FACTS,The defence was that both mortgages were satisfied.
FACTS,"The main evidence on which the defendant relied to prove satisfaction was an agreement dated the 17th of October, 1937, executed by the mortgagee Narayan Gopal Sathe in favour of the defendant."
FACTS,The document has been excluded from evidence by the trial Court as well as by the High Court on appeal on the ground that it required registration.
FACTS,"If this document is excluded, then there is a concurrent finding of fact by both the Courts that the rest of the evidence is not good enough to prove satisfaction."
FACTS,They have disbelieved it and decreed the plaintiff 's claim in full.
FACTS,"The only ques tions before us are (1) whether this document required registration and (2) whether, if it did, it 493 cannot still be used for what the defendant claims is a collateral purpose, namely proving full payment of the mortgage amount."
FACTS,The agreement came about in this fashion.
FACTS,"The mortga gee, Narayan Sathe, was appointed Receiver of two Cinemas in Poona."
FACTS,"The Court appointing him required him to produce a surety in the sum of Rs. 10,000."
FACTS,The defendant agreed to undertake this responsibility and as a consideration for that the mortgagee executed the agreement in question.
FACTS,The portions of the document relevant for the present purpose are as follows.
FACTS,"The mortgages are there described as the ""transactions of give and take."" ""(3) It is extremely necessary to explain beforehand the transaction of give and take outstanding between both of us. (4) Whereas two transactions have been done between you and me."
FACTS,Therefore you have agreed to stand surety.
FACTS,And only for that reason I am executing this agreement and giving it to you in writing and thereunder I am settling and formulating some new terms and I am confirming some very terms which were declared before.
FACTS,"(5) Although in the matter of the transaction relating to the aforesaid mortgage deeds the rate of interest men tioned in the documents purporting to be the mortgage deeds is 14 annas per mensem per centum, still the actual interest is to be received only at the rate of 8 annas per mensem per centum; so it is settled between you and me and I have also agreed to the same."
FACTS,"And even at that rate I have also been receiving the interest and I shall also receive hereafter. (6) As regards the transaction of the second mortgage deed. if as agreed at that time between you and me you pay me Rs. 1,800 in the lump then it will be understood that the transaction of give and take subsisting between you and me has been wholly completed and fully paid up."
FACTS,As you have no sufficiency of funds to make up and pay in full the above sum at once it is settled that you are to pay to me Rs. 80 per 64 494 month and thus you are to make payment in full.
FACTS,In accord ance with the agreement arrived at between us both subse quent to the document purporting to be the second mortgage deed the said documents and papers and the written receipts in respect of interest given to you by me relating to the payment in full made by you in respect of interest and principal on account of the first transaction dated 7 4 31 have been kept with me.
FACTS,* * (8) As mentioned above (vide paras 5 and 6) no interest of any nature whatever has remained claimable by me from you in accordance with the agreement arrived at between us both from the date of your suretyship onward and prior to it and in like manner I understand that the whole of the principal has been fully paid.
FACTS,(10) If you so wish or if necessity may arise then at any time you may ask for it and I shall give you this agree ment on being written out on stamped paper and on being registered.
FACTS,""" In our opinion, this is a document which limits and extinguishes interests in immoveable property in the present within the meaning of section 17(1) (b) of the Indian Regis tration Act."
FACTS,Clause (4) of the agreement expressly says so.
FACTS,"Referring to the two mortgages it says ""I am settling and formulating some new terms."
FACTS,""" This speaks from the present."
FACTS,"It does not say that this was some past agreement, and that fact is underlined in the next sentence which reads ""and I am confirming some very terms which were declared before."
FACTS,""" Among the new terms is the following."
FACTS,The rate of inter est agreed upon in the two mortgage deeds was 14 annas per cent per month.
FACTS,Clause (5) reduces this to 8 annas.
REASONING,It is true that according to clause (5) only 8 annas had actually been paid all along but that hardly 495 matters because the question is not what was paid but what was due and what the mortgagee could have enforced under his bond.
REASONING,It is evident from clause (4) that it was the agree ment embodied in the document which effected the change and therefore it was the document itself which brought the altered terms into being.
REASONING,The next question is whether this limits an interest in immoveable property.
REASONING,We are of opinion it does.
PRECEDENT,"We agree with the learned Rangoon Judges in U. Po Thin vs Official Assignee(1) that one part of the ""interest"" which a mortga gee has in mortgaged property is the right to receive inter est at a certain rate when the document provides for inter est."
REASONING,"If that rate is varied, whether to his advantage or otherwise, then, in our judgment, his ""interest"" in the property is affected."
REASONING,"If the subsequent agreement substi tutes a higher rate, then to the extent of the difference it ""creates"" a fresh ""interest"" which was not there before."
REASONING,"If the rate is lowered, then his original ""interest"" is limited."
REASONING,The question of a higher rate was considered by their Lordships of the Privy Council in Tika Ram vs Deputy Commis sioner of Bara Banki(2).
REASONING,"There, the mortgagors gave the mortgagees an unregistered rukka or written promise simulta neously with the registered mortgage stipulating that they would pay an extra 6 per cent per annum over and above the 15 per cent entered in the mortgage."
REASONING,their Lordships held that these rukkas could not be used to fetter the equity of redemption.
REASONING,"They did not decide whether the personal cove nant in the rukkas could be enforced because that point had not been raised in the plaint and pleadings, nor did they refer to the Registration Act, but we think the words ""an unregistered instrument which the statute declares is not to affect the mortgaged property"" can only have reference to that Act."
REASONING,(1) (1938) R.L.R. 293: A.I.R. 1938 R. 285.
REASONING,(2) (1899) 26 I.A. 97 at 100.
PRECEDENT,"496 It was argued, on the strength of Mahim Chandra Dey vs Ram Dayal Dutta,(1) Ram Ranjan vs Jayanti lal(2) and Collec tor of Etah vs Kishori Lal(3), that it is always open to a mortgagee to release or remit a part of the debt, and when he does so he does not limit or extinguish an interest in immovable property any more than when he passes a receipt acknowledging payment of the whole or part of the money."
REASONING,"The effect of the payment, or of the release, may be to extin guish the mortgage but in themselves they do not limit the interest."
REASONING,"Extending this, the learned counsel for the defendant contended that when a mortgagee agrees to accept a lower rate of interest he does no more than release that part of the debt which would be covered by the difference in rate."
REASONING,We do not agree.
REASONING,There is a difference between a re ceipt and a remission or a release.
REASONING,"A receipt is not the payment, nor does the document in such a case serve to extinguish the mortgage or limit the liability."
REASONING,It is the payment of the money which does that and the receipt does no more than evidence the fact.
REASONING,Not so a release.
REASONING,The extin guishment or diminution of liability is in that event ef fected by the agreement itself and not by something external to it.
REASONING,"If the agreement is oral, it is hit by proviso 4 to section 92 of the Evidence Act, for it ""rescinds"" or ""modi fies"" the contract of mortgage."
REASONING,"If it is in writing, it is hit by section 17 (1) (b) of the Registration Act, for in that case the writing itself ""limits"" or ""extinguishes"" the liability under the mortgage."
REASONING,"It is to be observed that when the mortgagor pays money due on the mortgage, in whole or in part, he is carrying out the terms of the bond and is not making any alteration in it, and even though the fact of payment may limit or extin guish the mortgagee 's interest that is only because the bond is working itself out by the force of its own terms and not by reason of some new agreement which seeks to modify it or limit or extinguish the interest which it creates."
REASONING,A simple test (1)A.I.R. (3) A.I.R. 1930 All. 721 at 725 F.B. (2) A.I.R. 1926 Cal. 906.
REASONING,"497 is this: see whether the mortgagee can, in the face of the subsequent agreement, enforce the terms of his bond."
REASONING,"If he cannot, then it is plain that the subsequent undertaking has effected a modification, and if that has the effect of limiting or extinguishing the mortgagee 's interest, it is at once hit either by section 17 (1) (b) or section 92 proviso 4."
REASONING,"But when there is a mere payment of money, that is done under the terms of the bond, for the contract of mortgage postulates that the mortgagor should repay the money bor rowed and that when he does so the mortgagee 's interest in the property shall be ""limited"" to the extent of the repay ment or, when all is repaid, be wholly extinguished; nor, of course, does a payment have to be made by a written or registered instrument, or even evidenced by one."
REASONING,Clause (xi) to section 17 (2) of the Registration Act is based on this principle.
REASONING,"It draws a distinction between a document which, by the force of its terms."
REASONING,"effects the extinguishment, or purports to do so, and one which merely evidences an exter nal fact which brings about that result."
REASONING,Now apply the test just given to the present case.
REASONING,Under the mortgages the mortgagee is entitled to interest at 14 annas per cent.
REASONING,per month but the mortgagor says he cannot claim that.
REASONING,"Why ? Because, according to him, the subsequent agreement altered the terms of the bond and reduced his liability to only 8 annas."
REASONING,"It hardly matters what the agreement is called, whether a release or a remission, nor is it germane to the question that the mortgagee is enti tled to remit or release the whole or a part of the debt; the fact remains that his agreement to do so effects an alteration in the original contract and by the force of its terms or extinguishes his interest, Assume that the mortga gor repaid the whole of the interest at the altered rate and the whole of the principaL, would those repayments by them selves effect an extinguishment of the mortgage ? Clearly not, because unless the subsequent agreement is called in aid, more would be due under the terms of the bond on ac count of the higher rate of interest."
REASONING,It is evident then that it is the 498 agreement which limits the mortgagee 's interest ' and serves to extinguish the mortgage and not mere payment at the reduced rate.
REASONING,Similar observations apply to clause (6) of the agree ment.
REASONING,"It begins by reciting a past agreement in which the mortgagor had promised to pay Rs. 1,800 in a lump sum."
REASONING,We are left to infer that this was to extinguish the mortgage.
REASONING,"If it was, then it would be hit by either section 92, provi so 4, of the Evidence Act or section 17(1)(b) of the Regis tration Act, but that does not matter because the present document varies even that agreement and substitutes a third agreement in its place, namely that payment of Rs. 1,800 by instalments at the rate of Rs 80 a month will effect ""pay ment in full"", that is to say, will extinguish the mortgage."
REASONING,"This speaks from the date of the document, for it says, referring to this agreement, that ' it is settled"" etc."
REASONING,Next we come to clause (8).
REASONING,"That refers us back to clauses (5) and (6) and says that ""as mentioned there no interest of any nature whatever has remained claimable by me"" and speaking of the principal says ""and in like manner I understand the whole of the prin cipal has been fully paid""."
REASONING,We have already dealt with clauses (5) and (6).
REASONING,"Clause (8) carries us no further and merely states that because of clauses (5) and (6) neither interest nor principal is now claimable; and of course if neither interest nor principal is claimable that extinguish es the mortgage, and in this case the extinguishment is brought about, not by mere payment in accordance with the terms of the bond, but because of the fresh agreement."
REASONING,Clause (10) remains for consideration.
REASONING,It was argued that this brings the matter within section 17(2) (v) of the Registration Act because it gives the defendant the right to obtain another document which will effect the extinguish ment.
REASONING,"We do not agree because clause (v) of sub section (2) of section 17 of the Act postulates that the document shall not of itself create, declare, 499 assign, limit, extinguish any right etc., and that it shall merely create a right to obtain another document etc."
REASONING,"(The stress is on the words ""itself"" and ""merely "". ) We agree with Sir Dinsha Mulla at page 86 of the 5th edition of his Indian Registration Act that ""If the document itself creates an interest in immove able property, the fact that it contemplates the execution of another document will not exempt it from registration under this clause."
REASONING,""" As we have seen, this document of itself limits or extinguishes certain interests in the mortgaged property),."
REASONING,The operative words are reasonably clear.
REASONING,"Consequently, the document is not one which merely confers a right to obtain another document."
REASONING,"It confers the right only in certain contingencies, namely, ""if you so wish"" or ""if necessity may arise."
REASONING,""" Its purport is to effect an immediate alteration in the terms of the two bonds and because of that alteration to effect an immediate extinguishment and limitation."
REASONING,"Clause (10) merely confers an additional right, namely the right to obtain another document ""if you so wish"" or ""if necessity may arise."" Therefore, the document in question is not one which merely creates a right to obtain another."
REASONING,"An agreement to sell, or an agreement to transfer at some future date, is to be distinguished because that sort of document does not of itself purport to effect the trans fer."
REASONING,"It merely embodies a present agreement to execute another document in the future which will, when executed, have that effect."
REASONING,The document in hand is not of that type.
REASONING,It does not postpone the effect of extinguishment or limita tion of the mortgages to a future date.
REASONING,It does not say that the agreement it embodies shall take effect in the future.
REASONING,"It purports to limit and extinguish the liabilities on the two mortgages at once by virtue of the document itself and merely adds that ""if it is necessary or should you want another document, I will repeat the present 500 agreement in a registered agreement."
REASONING,""" By implication it means that if it is not necessary, or if the mortgagor does not want a registered instrument, the document itself will have effect."
REASONING,"Incidentally, one effect of holding that this document does not limit or extinguish the mortgagor 's li ability would be that there is no agreement to that effect yet in force, This may or may not give the mortgagor a right to obtain specific performance of his right to obtain such an agreement but until he does that there would be no bar to the mortgagee 's claim in this suit."
REASONING,"However, it is not necessary to go as far as that because we are of opinion that this document is not exempt from registration under section 17(2) (v), and we so hold."
REASONING,The next question is whether the document can be used in evidence under the proviso to section 49 of the Registration Act.
REASONING,We are clear it cannot.
REASONING,This is not a suit for specif ic performance nor does any question of part performance under section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act arise.
REASONING,It remains then to be seen whether the use now sought to be made of the document is to evidence a collateral transaction not required to be evidenced by a registered instrument.
REASONING,"But what is the 'transaction sought to be proved but the very agreement which the document not merely evidences but, by reason of its own force, creates ? That is not a collat eral transaction and even if it were a transaction of that type, it would require a registered instrument for the reasons we have already given."
REASONING,"Section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act was re ferred to but it has no application, for the agreement we are concerned with is not a transfer."
REASONING,There are no words of conveyance in it; also the mortgagor is not continuing in possession in part performance of the contract.
REASONING,Both mort gages were simple and the right to possession never resided in the mortgagee.
REASONING,"He might in due course have acquired it by process of law if he obtained a decree and purchased at the sale; on the other hand, a stranger might have purchased and the right to possession would 'in that event have passed elsewhere, But he had no right to possession at the 501 date of the agreement and having none he could not have transferred it."
REASONING,The mortgagor 's possession was consequently not referable to the agreement.
RPC,The appeal fails and is dismissed with costs.
RPC,Appeal dismissed.

JUDGE,Judgment was delivered by BOSE J. PATANJALI SASTRI C.J. and DAS J. agreed with Bose J. Bose J.
FACTS,The plaintiff claims to be the sole Saranjamdar and seeks certain declarations and other reliefs appropriate to such a claim.
FACTS,The first and second defendants are members of the plaintiff 's family while the third defendant is the State of Bombay (Province of Bombay at the date of the suit).
FACTS,The only question is whether the suit is barred by section 4 (a) of Bombay Act X of 1876 (Bombay Revenue Juris diction Act).
FACTS,The following genealogical tree will show the relation ship between the parties: Bhujangrao Appasaheb (British grantee) Daulatrao I (died 24 7 1864) Bhujangrao I Malojirao Yeshwantrao alias (died 1881 ) : Annasaheb : : : (widow) Krishnabai Daulatrao III Bhujangrao II Daulatrao II (Del. 1) (Def. 2) (died 8 5 1931) : Bhujangrao III (Plaintiff) 405 The facts are as follows.
FACTS,A common ancestor of the present parties was given the Gajendragad estate as a Saran jam some time before the advent of the British.
FACTS,"When they arrived on the scene they decided, as far as possible, to continue such Saranjams, jagirs and inams as had been grant ed by the earlier rulers, and accordingly they framed rules under Schedule B, Rule 10 of Bombay Act XI of 1852 (The Bombay Rent Free Estates Act of 1852) to regulate the mode of recognition and the succession and conditions of tenure to Saranjams, which are analogous to jagirs."
FACTS,"In compliance with this, the common ancestor shown at the head of the genealogical tree set out above was recognised by the Brit ish Government as the Saranjamdar of the Gajendragad estate."
FACTS,He may for convenience be termed the British Grantee.
FACTS,The Register exhibit P 53 shows that the estate consisted of 26 villages.
FACTS,"We do not know the date of the British recognition but the nature of the tenure is described as follows : ""Continuable to all male legitimate descendants of the holder at the time of British conquest, viz., Bhujangrao Appasaheb, the first British Grantee, son of Bahirojirao Ghorpade."
FACTS,""" On the death of the British Grantee (Bhujangrao Appa saheb) he was succeeded by his son Daulatrao I who died on the 24th of July, 1864."
FACTS,"This Daulatrao I left three sons, Bhujangrao I, Yeshwantrao and Malojirao."
FACTS,In the year 1866 Bhujangrao I and his brother Yesh wantrao alias Annasaheb sued Malojirao for possession of this Saranjam.
FACTS,A question of impartibility was raised but the Bombay High Court declared that the property in British India was partible.
FACTS,"They further declared that Bhujangrao I was the head of the family and as such was entitled to a special assignment which was not to exceed a quarter share, for the expenses and duties which might devolve on him by virtue of his position, and that after this had been set aside each of the three brothers was entitled to an equal one third Share in the landed property in India."
FACTS,"This judgment 406 is reported in The duties enumerated at page 170 included the ""keeping up of armed retainers for the fort of Gajendragad, and for the improvement of that vil lage, which was the chief seat of this branch of the Ghor pade family, and also to enable him to distribute on ceremo nial occasions the customary presents to the junior members of the family."
FACTS,""" The judgment is dated the 12th of October, 1868."
FACTS,As a consequence a division of the property was ef fected.
FACTS,Malojirao separated himself from his brothers and was allotted seven villages.
FACTS,The other two brothers continued joint and took the remainder.
FACTS,But this was only with respect to property situate in British India.
FACTS,The parties also had property in the State of Kolhapur.
FACTS,That was left undivided.
FACTS,Bhujangrao I died in 1881 and his younger brother Yesh wantrao (alias Annasaheb) claimed to succeed as the sole heir.
FACTS,The Political Department of the Government of India refused to recognise this claim and permitted Bhujangrao I 's widow Krishnabai to adopt a a boy from the family and recog nised him as the heir in respect of that portion of the estate which lay within the Principality of Kolhapur.
FACTS,"This was on the 3rd of February, 1882."
FACTS,The Bombay Government followed a similar course regarding the property in British India.
FACTS,"On the 26th of April, 1882, they passed a Resolution embodying the follow ing decision: (1) The adoption was to be recognised and the adopted son was to occupy the same position as his adoptive father, that is to say, he was to get one third of the property plus the assignment given to him as head of the family."
FACTS,(2) Malojirao who had already taken his share of the estate was to continue in possession.
FACTS,(3) Yeshwantrao (alias Annasaheb) was given the option of remaining joint with the adopted boy or separating.
FACTS,"Finally, the Resolution Concluded 407 ``The two brothers will hold their respective shares as their private property in virtue of the decree of the High Court and the Jahagir will henceforth be restricted to the portion awarded by the High Court to Bhujangrao which the adopted son will now inherit."
FACTS,It should however be clearly understood that the decision of the High Court is not to be held as a precedent and that no partition of the Jahagir Estate to be continued to the adopted son will ever be allowed.
FACTS,""" This position was emphasised by Government in the same year on the 22nd August, 1882."
FACTS,"Krishnabai, who had been allowed by Government to adopt Daulatrao II, asked that her husband 's one third share in the estate be also treated as private property in the same way as the shares of the other two brothers."
FACTS,"This prayer was refused and Government stat ed: ""It should be plainly understood that Government allow the adoption to be made by her only in consideration of Bhujangrao 's one third share as well as the portion assigned to him as head of the family being continued to the adopted son as indivisible Jahagir Estate descending in the line of male heirs in the order of primogeniture and subject to no terms whatsoever as to the enjoyment of the same by Krishna bai during her lifetime."
FACTS,""" The position was re examined by Government in 1891 and its decision was embodied in the following resolution dated the 17th of March, 1891: ""It appears to Government that the whole Gajendragad Estate is a Saranjam continuable as hereditary in the full est sense of the word as interpreted by the Court of Direc tors in paragraph 9 of their Despatch No. 27 dated 12th December, 1855."
FACTS,It is continuable to all male legitimate descendants of the holder at the time of the British con quest; and should Government ever sanction an adoption the terms of sanction would be those applicable to Saranjamdars.
FACTS,The property should be dealt with like Other Saranjams in the Political Department.
FACTS,""" 53 408 In the year 1901 the adopted son Daulatrao II sued Yeshwantrao 's son Bhujangrao II for partition."
FACTS,"It will be remembered that in the litigation of 1866, which ended in the Bombay High Court 's judgment reported in 5 Bom."
FACTS,"H.C.R. 161, Malojirao alone separated and the other two brothers continued joint."
FACTS,The litigation of 1901 put an end to that position.
FACTS,"High Court 's judgment dated the 12th of March, 1908, makes it clear that as Government was not a party to that litigation its rights against either or both of the parties were not affected."
FACTS,But as between the parties inter se they were bound by the previous decision and so the adopted son was entitled to partition and separate posses sion of such properties as might fall to his share.
FACTS,After this decision was given the two partitioned the property between themselves amicably.
FACTS,In or about the year 1930 a Record of Rights was intro duced in fourteen of the villages in the Gajendragad Jaha gir and a dispute arose again between the three branches of the family.
FACTS,"The District Deputy Collector, after inspecting the records, found that ""the name of the Khatedar Saran jamdar alone has found place in the village Inam register, in the Saranjam list and the land alienation register,"" while in the other village records the various members of the family were entered according to the ""actual wahivat or enjoyment."" After due consideration he thought that the interest of Government and the Saranjamdar would be sufficiently safeguarded by allowing the same position to continue."
FACTS,He ordered the entries to be made accordingly.
FACTS,The order also discloses that the matter had been referred to the Legal Remembrancer to the Bombay Government.
FACTS,"In the meanwhile, on the 5th of May, 1898, a set of Rules framed under Schedule B, Rule 10, of the Bombay Rent Free Estates Act of 1852 were drawn up and published in the Bombay Gazette."
FACTS,"These Rules were republished, probably with some modification, in the Gazette of 8th July, 1901."
FACTS,"The portions applicable here were as follows: 409 ""I. Saranjams shall ordinarily be continued in accordance with the decision already passed by Government in each case."
FACTS,"A Saranjam which has been decided to be hereditarily continuable shall ordinarily descend to the eldest male representative, in the order of primogeniture, of the senior branch of the family descended from the first British Gran tee or any of his brothers who were undivided in interest."
FACTS,"But Government reserve to themselves their rights for suffi cient reason to direct the continuance of the Saranjam to any other member of the said family, or as an act of grace, to a person adopted into the same family with the sanction of Government."
FACTS,V. Every Saranjam shall be held as a life estate.
FACTS,"It shall be formally resumed on the death of the holder and in cases in which it is capable of further continuance it shall be made over to the next holder as a fresh grant from Gov ernment, unencumbered by any debts, or charges, save such as may be specially imposed by Government itself."
FACTS,No Saranjam shall be capable of sub division.
FACTS,"Every Saranjamdar shall be responsible for making a suitable provision for the maintenance of. ""(certain members of the family enumerated in the Rule)."
FACTS,"If an order passed by Government under Rule VII is not carried out, Government may, whatever the reason may be, direct the Saranjam, or a portion of it, to be resumed. ."
FACTS,Provision for the members of the Saranjam dar 's family entitled to maintenance shall then be made by Government out of the revenues of the Saranjam so resumed.
FACTS,""" After the District Deputy Collector 's orders were passed on the 20th of May, 1930, Daulatrao II died on the 8th of May, 1931, and the matter was again taken up by Government."
FACTS,"This time it passed the following 410 Resolution on the 7th of June, 1932."
FACTS,"The Resolution was headed, ""Resumption and regrant of the Gajendragad Saranjam standing at No. 91 of the Saranjam List."
FACTS,""" It reads ""Resolution : The Governor in Council is pleased to direct that the Gajendragad Saranjam should be formally resumed and regranted to Bhujangrao Daulatrao Ghorpade eldest son of the deceased Saranjamdar Sardar Daulatrao Bhujangrao Ghorpade and that it should be entered in his sole name in the accounts of the Collector of Dharwar with effect from the date of the death of the last holder."
FACTS,The Collector should take steps to place the Saranjamdar in possession of the villages of the Saranjam estate which were in possession of the deceased Saranjamdar.
FACTS,"The Governor in Council agrees with the Commis sioner, Southern Division, that the assignments held by the Bhaubands as potgi holders should be continued to them as at present."
FACTS,""" The Bhujangrao mentioned in the Resolution is the plain tiff who is shown as Bhujangrao III in the genealogical tree."
FACTS,"The defendants were evidently aggrieved by this, for they filed Suit No. 23 of 1934 against the present plaintiff and the Secretary of State/or India in Council praying inter alia ""that the properties in that suit, viz., the villages allotted to their shares, were their independent and private properties and in case they were held to be Saranjam proper ties, they be declared as independent Saranjams, separate and distinct from the one held by the present plaintiff."
FACTS,""" This suit was withdrawn with liberty to bring a fresh suit on the same cause of action against the present plain tiff but not against the Secretary of State for India in Council."
FACTS,"According to defendants 1 and 2, this was pursuant to an arrangement between the Government and themselves that Government would issue a fresh Resolution in terms of the earlier Resolution dated the 17th of March, 1891."
FACTS,411 This was done.
FACTS,"On the 25th of February, 1936, Government passed the following Resolution : ""Resolution : After careful consideration the Governor in Council is pleased to confirm the decision in Government Resolution (Political Department) No. 1769 dated the 17th of March, 1891,and to declare that the whole of the Gajendragad Estate shall be continuable as an inalienable and impartible Saranjam on the conditions stated in the said Resolution."
FACTS,"Having regard, however, to the manner in which different portions of the estate have been held by different branches of the family, the Governor in Council, in modification of the orders contained in Government Resolution No. 8969 dated the 7th June, 1932, is pleased to direct that the portions of the said estate held by Sardar Bhujangrao Daulatrao Ghorpade, Daulatrao Malojirao Ghorpade and Bhujangrao Yeshwantrao Ghorpade, respectively, shall henceforth be entered in the Revenue Records as de facto shares in the said estate held by the said persons as representatives, respectively, of three branches of the Ghorpade family."
FACTS,"Each of the said de facto shares shall be continuable hereditarily as such as ii it were a separate Saranjam estate in accordance with the rules made for the continuance of Saranjams by the Governor in Council in exercise of the powers referred to in the rules framed under the Bombay Rent Free Estates Act, 1852, and section 2 (3) of the Bombay Summary Settlement Act (VII of 1863) and such special orders as the Governor in Council may make in regard to the Gajendragad Estate as a whole or in regard to the said share."
FACTS,The recognition of the aforesaid shares and their entry in the Revenue Records as separate shares shall not be deemed to amount to a recognition of the estate of Gajendragad as in any manner partible or alienable and shall not in any way affect the right of Government to treat the said estate as an entire impartible and inalien able Saranjam estate.
FACTS,"The Governor in Council further directs that the aforesaid shares shall in no case be capable of 412 sub division and shall not in any way be alienated or encum bered except in accordance with the rules and orders re ferred to above. "" The present suit is an attack on the action of Govern ment in passing this Resolution."
FACTS,The first and second defendants are the present representatives of the other branches of the family and the third defendant is the Prov ince of Bombay (now the State of Bombay).
FACTS,"The plaint states ""9."
FACTS,Government can have no jurisdiction to deprive the plaintiff at any rate during his lifetime of the full bene fit of all the rights and privileges appertaining to the holder of a Saranjam.
FACTS,"The Order of Government of the 8th February, 1936 is, therefore, ultra vires and in no way binding on the present plaintiff. 10."
FACTS,"Defendants 1 and 2, therefore, are not entitled to any rights or privileges claimable by the holder of a Saran jam which according to the G.R. is continuable 'as an inali enable and impartible Saranjam ', such as for example in the matter of appointment of the village officers in any of the 27 villages appertaining to the Gajendragad Saranjam."
FACTS,The cause of action arose in April 1938 and the resolution and the entry being ultra vires is not binding. 12.
FACTS,"As this is a suit claiming for relief primarily against defendants 1 and 2, defendant 3 is made a party to the suit in order to enable Government (defendant 3) to give proper effect to the decision of Government of the 17th March, 1891, and of 7th June, 1932, as against defendants 1 and 2 who have no right to the position which they claim. "" The reliefs prayed for are ""(a) That it be declared that defendants 1 and 2 have no right to go behind the order of the Government as per Reso lution No. 8969 of 7th June, 1932, under which plaintiff is entitled to be recognised as the sole Saranjamdar in the Revenue Records, and that the assignments held by defendants 1 and 2 are held by them as mere potgi holders."
FACTS,"413 (b) That in consequence of his position of a sole Saran jamdar the plaintiff alone at any rate during his lifetime has the sole right to the rights and privileges appertaining to the post of a sole Saranjamdar, to wit, to be consulted in the appointment of the village officers in all the villages appertaining to the Saranjam estate, but assigned to defendants 1 and 2 for potgi. (c) Defendants 1 and 2 be restrained from doing any acts or taking any steps in contravention of the aforesaid right of the plaintiff."
FACTS,"(d) That it be declared that defendant 3 (Government) have no right to change the Resolution No. 8969 of 7th June, 1932, and at any rate during the lifetime of the plaintiff."
FACTS,""" The first Court dismissed the plaintiff 's claim on the merits holding that Government had the right to amend its Resolution in the way it did."
FACTS,"The lower appellate Court also dismissed the suit on three grounds: (1) that the two previous decisions of 1868 and 1908 operate as res judicata, (2) that the impugned Resolution is intra vires and (3) that section 4 (a) and (d) of the Revenue Jurisdiction Act bars the jurisdiction of the Court."
FACTS,"In second appeal the High Court only considered the question of jurisdiction and, agreeing with the lower appel late Court on the point, dismissed the appeal but it granted the plaintiff leave to appeal to this Court."
FACTS,The only question we have to consider is the one of jurisdiction.
FACTS,"Section 4 of the Bombay Revenue Jurisdiction Act, 1876 (Bombay Act X of 1876), runs Subject to the exceptions hereinafter appearing, no Civil Court shall exercise jurisdiction as to (a). claims against the Crown relating to lands. held as Saranjam. "" It was strenuously contended that this is not a claim against the Crown but one against the first and second defendants."
FACTS,"That, in my opinion, is an idle contention in view of paragraphs 9 and 12 of the plaint and reliefs (a)and (d)."
FACTS,"In any event, Mr. Somayya was asked whether he would strike out the third defendant 414 and those portions of the plaint which sought relief against it."
FACTS,He said he was not prepared to do so.
REASONING,I cannot see how a plaintiff can insist on retaining a person against whom he claims no relief as a party.
REASONING,"I am clear that this is a suit against the ""Crown"" within the meaning of section 4(a)."
REASONING,"The next question is whether, assuming that to be the case, it is also one ""relating to lands held as Saranjam."
REASONING,""" So far as the reliefs sought against Government are concerned, that is clearly the case."
REASONING,Paragraph 9 of the plaint challenges Government 's jurisdiction to deprive the plaintiff of the full benefit of all rights and privileges appertaining to the holder of a Saranjam.
REASONING,"These rights cannot exist apart from the lands which form part of the Saranjam estate and the implication of the prayer is that Government has, for example, no right to resume the Saranjam either under Rule V on the death of the last Saran jamdar or under Rule IX during his lifetime."
REASONING,"It is to be observed that a resumption under Rule IX can only be of the land because the rule directs that when the Saranjam is resumed Government itself shall make provisions for the maintenance of those entitled to it ""out of the revenues of the Saranjam so resumed."
REASONING,""" These revenues can only come out of the land."
REASONING,"Relief (d) in the prayer clause seeks a declaration that Government has no right to change Resolution No. 8969 dated the 7th of June, 1932."
REASONING,That Resolution directly relates to the land because it directs that the Gajendragad Saranjam be resumed and the Collector is directed to take steps to place the Saranjamdar in possession of the villages of the Saran jam estate etc.
REASONING,It is impossible to contend that this is not a claim relating to lands held as Saranjam.
REASONING,It was next argued that if that be the case the claim against Government can be dismissed and the plaintiff can at least be given the reliefs claimed against the other two defendants.
REASONING,"These, it was contended, do not relate to land and in any event are not claims against the ""Crown""."
REASONING,"415 In my opinion, this is not a suit in which the rights claimed against the other defendants can be divorced from the claim against Government and considered separately."
REASONING,That is evident enough from paragraph 10 of the plaint.
REASONING,"In para graph 9 the power of Government to deprive the plaintiff of the rights he claims is challenged and in paragraph 10 the plaintiff explains that ""therefore"" the first and second defendants are not entitled to any of the rights and privileges of the Saranjamdar."
REASONING,"One of those rights, as we have seen from Rules VII and IX, is to take the revenues of the entire estate in order that he might fulfil his obligation regarding the payment of maintenance to certain members of the family; and if the defendants claim to hold their lands under the orders of Government and the plaintiff insists on retaining Government as a party in order that it may be bound by the decree he wants against the other defendants it is obvious that his claim against these defendants cannot be separated from his claim against the Government."
REASONING,"In any event, if the claim against Government is to be ignored it can only be on the basis that its orders cannot be challenged and if the orders stand it is evident that the plaintiff can have no hope of success because both sides hold their respective properties on the basis of those orders."
REASONING,There are two decisions of the Bombay High Court which have taken this view.
PRECEDENT,Basalingappagouda vs The Secretary of State for India(1) was a Watan case.
REASONING,Government had recog nised the second defendant as the Watandar.
REASONING,Plaintiff sued Government and the second defendant and sought a declaration and injunction.
REASONING,"On being faced with the dilemma that the suit against Government did not lie because of section 4 (a) (3) of the Bombay Revenue Jurisdiction Act of 1876, he asked the Court, as here, to leave the Government out of consider ation and decree his claim against the second defendant alone."
REASONING,The learned Judges held that that would amount to striking out the main relief sought against both the defend ants and would entirely (1) 28 Born.
REASONING,L.R. 651.
REASONING,"54 416 change the character of the suit and added that ""as long as the Secretary of State is a party to the suit, such a decla ration could not be granted."
PRECEDENT,""" In the other case, Basangauda vs The Secretary State(1), Beaumont C.J. and Baker J. took the same view."
REASONING,"They said ""Mr. Gumaste, who appears for the appellant, says that his claim is not a claim against the Government but in that case he ought to strike out the Government."
REASONING,"He is not pre pared to strike out the Government, because if he does they will not be bound by these proceedings and will follow the decision of their revenue tribunals."
REASONING,"Therefore, he wants to make the Government a party in order that they may be bound."
REASONING,"But, if they remain a party, it seems to me that there is a claim against them relating to property appertaining to the office of an hereditary officer, although no doubt it is quite true that the appellant does not desire to get any order against the Government as to the way in which the property should be dealt ' with or anything of the sort, and he only wants a declaration as to his title which will bind Government."" They held that the jurisdiction of the courts was oust ed."
PRECEDENT,"It was next contended, on the strength of a decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council reported in Province of Bombay vs Horrnusji Manekji(2)."
REASONING,that the courts have jurisdiction to decide whether Government acted in excess of its powers and that that question must be decided first.
REASONING,"In my opinion, this decision does not apply here."
REASONING,Their Lordships were dealing with a case falling under section 4 (b) of the Bombay Revenue Jurisdiction Act of 1876.
REASONING,"That provides that "". no Civil Court shall exercise jurisdiction as to. . (b) objections to the amount or incidence of any assess ment of land revenue authorised by the Provincial Govern ment."
REASONING,""" (1) (2) 74 I A. 103 417 As pointed out by Strangman K.C., on behalf of the plaintiff respondent, ""authorised"" must mean ""duly autho rised,"" and in that particular case the impugned assessment would not be duly authorised if the Government Resolution of 11 4 1990 purporting to treat the agreement relied on by the respondent as cancelled and authorising the levy of the full assessment was ultra vires under section 211 of the Land Revenue Code."
REASONING,"Thus, before the exclusion of the Civil Court 's jurisdiction under section 4 (b) could come into play, the Court had to determine the issue of ultra vires."
REASONING,"Consequently, their Lordships held that that question was outside the scope of the bar."
REASONING,But the position here is different.
REASONING,We are concerned here with section 4 (a) and under that no question about an authorised act of Government arises.
REASONING,"The section is general and bars all ""claims against the Crown relating to lands. held as Saranjam."
REASONING,""" That is to say, even if the Government 's act in relation to such lands was ultra vires, a claim impugning the validity of such an act would fall within the scope of the exclusion in clause (a) provided it relates to such land."
REASONING,There is a difference of opinion in the Bombay High Court as to whether section 4 is attracted if the only relief sought against Government is a declaration.
REASONING,"One set of decisions holds that that does not amount to a ""claim against Government."
PRECEDENT,""" Dattatraya Vishwanath vs The Secretary of State for India(1) is typical of that view."
PRECEDENT,"On the other hand, Daulatrao vs Government of bombay(2), a case relating to the Gajendragad estate, took the other view."
RPC,"In my opin ion, the latter view is correct."
RPC,"In my opinion, the decision of the High Court was right and I would dismiss the appeal with costs."
RPC,PATANJALI SASTRI C.J. I agree.
RPC,S.R. DAS J. I agree.
RPC,Appeal dismissed.

COUNSEL,"Jai Gopal Sethi (R. L. Kohli, with him) for the appel lant."
COUNSEL,"B.K. Khanna, Advocate."
JUDGE,The judgment of the court was deliv ered by FAZL ALI J.
STATUTE,"Mohinder Singh, under sections 302 and 307 read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, and rw"
FACTS,The case for the prosecution which has been substantial ly accepted by the trial Judge and the High Court is briefly as follows.
FACTS,"Sometime in January, 1949, one Bachittar Singh, brother of Dalip Singh who is said, to have been murdered, lodged a complaint before the NaibTehsildar at Zira to the effect that a tree belonging to him had been cut by 7 persons including Mohinder Singh, the appellant."
FACTS,"On the 28th February, 1949, which was the date fixed for the hearing of the case before the Naib TehsiIdar, Jita Singh and Dalip Singh, the two brothers of Bachittar Singh, were attacked by the appellant and one Gurnam Singh, a lad of 17, near a Gurdwara at about mid day, when 8:23 they were returning from their field."
FACTS,Jita Singh was then carrying a load of fodder on his head while Dalip Singh had sickles in his hand.
FACTS,Jita Singh was the first to be at tacked near a tailor 's shop by Mohinder Singh who fired at him from behind hitting him on the neck whereupon he fell down together with the bundle of fodder.
FACTS,"Dalip Singh, who was following Jita Singh, then ran backwards and he was chased by Gurnam Singh round the outer boundary of a tank which was close by."
FACTS,Mohinder Singh ran on the other side of the tank in the opposite direction and confronted him and shot him with a gun on the chest whereupon he fell down.
FACTS,"Meanwhile, Gurnam Singh had also reached the spot and he fired with his rifle from a distance of about 4 or 5 feet near about Dalip Singh 's ear while he was lying sideways."
FACTS,The injuries proved fatal and Dalip Singh died on the spot.
FACTS,"The same day at 3 p.m., Jita Singh went to the police station at Dharamkot, which is at a distance of 3 miles from village Augar, where the occurrence had taken place, and lodged a first information report, charging Mohinder Singh, with having caused injury to him, and Mohinder Singh and Gurnam Singh with the murder of Dalip Singh; and the police after investigating the case sent up a charge sheet against the two accused persons."
STATUTE,Thereafter they were tried by the Sessions Judge of Ferozepore under sections 302 and 307 read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.
RLC,The appellant was sentenced to death under section 302 and Gurnam Singh was sentenced to transportation for life under that section in view of his youth.
RLC,They were also sentenced to 3 years ' rigorous imprisonment each under section 307 read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.
FACTS,"It appears that Dalip Singh had 6 injuries altogether which are described by the doctor who performed the post mortem on his body in these words: "" 1."
FACTS,"An irregularly round gun shot wound on the left temporal region, 1"" diameter."
FACTS,"The wound is 22"" behind outer canthus of left eye, its upper portion is at a level with the top of the pinna of the left ear, 824 behind it commences at the cartilages of the ear which are broken."
FACTS,Brain is visible in the gap of the wound.
FACTS,"An area 4 "" x 4 "" is blackened, the wound being situated in the middle of this area."
FACTS,"A gun shot wound 3/4"" X 1/2"" on the back of right mastoid region, upper end of the wound is 1"" behind the root of the right ear."
FACTS,Direction is vertically oblique.
FACTS,"On dissection the left temporal bone under injury No. 1 is, hole and its petrous portion shattered."
FACTS,"A linear fracture extends upwards and backwards, from the hole into the left parietal and occipital bones."
FACTS,"After piercing through the left temporal lobe of the brain the projectile has pierced through the brainstem, and emerged out as injury No. 2, holding the mastoid region of the skull on the right side."
FACTS,"A gun shot wound 3/4"" X 5/8"" on the left side of chest 21/2"" above and behind the left nipple and 1/2"" behind the anterior axillary fold as area 1"" below the wound is bruised."
FACTS,"A gun shot wound 1/2""X 3/4"" on the right side of chest in the mid axillary line."
FACTS,"The top of the wound being 1 3/4"" from the apex of right axilla and 4 3/4"" above and behind the right nipple."
FACTS,"A gun shot wound 1/2""x 1/4"" on the inner aspect of the right arm, upper end of the wound is 11/4"" from the top of the anterior axillary fold."
FACTS,"A gun shot wound 3/4""X 1/2"" on the front of the right arm."
FACTS,"Its upper end being 21/2"" from the top of the anterior axillary fold."
FACTS,"Its distance from injury No. 5 being 1"" and it is inter connected with injury No. 5 under the skin."
FACTS,""" The doctor has stated in his evidence that in all two projectiles appeared to have hit Dalip Singh, and injuries Nos. 1 and 2 were caused by one of them, injury No. 1 being the wound of entrance and injury No. 2 being the wound of exit, With regard to the other 4 injuries, his evidence is as follows : ""Injury No. 3 is the wound of entrance of another projectile and No. 4 is the wound of its exit."
FACTS,"Wound 825 No. 5 is the wound of its re entrance and wound No. 6 the wound of its final exit from the body."" Jita Singh had 4 slight injuries on the back of the neck which are said to have been caused by pellets and two abra sions below the right elbow and right knee said to have been caused by blunt weapons."
FACTS,"It may be stated here that when the investigating police officer arrived at the scene of occurrence, he found an empty cartridge case at the place where Jita Singh is said to have been fired at, and 2 empty cartridge cases and a blood stained cap of a cartridge case near the place where the dead body of Dalip Singh was lying."
FACTS,"Later, when Mohinder Singh appeared before the police, he was asked whether he possessed a gun and he produced a 12 bore gun (exhibit P 16) for which he held a licence."
FACTS,"The gun and the empty cartridges were thereupon sent to Dr. Goyle, Director of the C.I.D. Laboratory, Phillaur, and the opinion that he submitted may be summed up as follows : The gun had signs of having been fired but he could not say when it was fired last."
FACTS,"The cartridge cases P 10 and P 15 could have been fired through the gun P 16, but he could not say wheth er they were actually fired from that particular gun or a similar gun or guns."
FACTS,"He did not make any experiment by firing any cartridge from the gun P 16, nor did he compare the markings on the empty cartridges P 10 and P 15."
FACTS,"A notable feature of the case is that the occurrence is said to have taken place in the vicinity of a Gurdwara and some houses, but in spite of this fact, not a single person of the locality has been cited or examined as a witness by the prosecution."
FACTS,"The whole case rests on the evidence of 3 witnesses, viz., Jita Singh, Harnam Singh and Buta Singh."
FACTS,"Jita Singh, who had been shot at from behind, claims to have seen the two accused firing at his brother."
FACTS,"Harnam Singh admittedly lives at a considerable distance from the place of occurrence but has stated that he was coming from another village where he had gone to fetch some medicine for his maternal cousin, when he 826 saw the occurrence."
FACTS,"Buta Singh, who is a tonga driver, belongs to a distant village and is somewhat remotely related to Harnam Singh, and accounts for his presence near the scene of occurrence by saying that he had come to see Harnarn Singh the evening before."
FACTS,"Harnam Singh admitted in his evidence that there was a dispute between him and Mohinder Singh nearly a month before the occurrence about a wall, but he also says that the dispute ' had been amicably settled by the panchayat""."
FACTS,There is nothing before us to show what the award of the panchayat was and whether or not it left any ill feeling behind.
FACTS,"But, on the argu ments of the counsel and the apparently trivial motive for which Dalip Singh is said to have been murdered, it would appear that among the class of persons with which we are concerned petty quarrels give rise to enmity which does not die soon or easily."
FACTS,"After the close of prosecution evidence in the Ses sions Court, the appellant was examined under section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code, and he denied that he had fired at Jita Singh and Dalip Singh with the gun P 16 and that Gurnam Singh had fired at Dalip Singh with a rifle."
FACTS,He added that he was not present in village Augur at the time of the alleged occurrence but had gone to Zira to attend the Naib Tehsildar 's court.
FACTS,"To establish his plea of alibi, he examined 3 witnesses in the court of the Sessions Judge."
FACTS,"The first witness was the Naib Tehsildar before whom Bachittar Singh had lodged the complaint, and he stated that when the case was called on the 28th February, 1949, 6 or 7 persons appeared in court."
FACTS,"He also proved an application for a taccavi loan which purports to have been filed by the appel lant on the 28th February, 1949, and bears his thumb impres sion."
FACTS,He further stated in his evidence that he had passed orders on that application on the 28th February but he did not know Mohinder Singh and therefore could not say who had produced that application before him on that date.
FACTS,"The second witness for the appellant was his brother in law, Jogindar Singh, who had written the application."
FACTS,exhibit D C.
FACTS,"He has stated that 827 Mohinder Singh himself was present in the court of the Naib Tehsildar on the 28th February, 1949, that he had signed the application (exhibit D C) and that he was also one of the persons who had appeared before the Tehsildar when Bachittar Singh 's case was called out."
FACTS,The third defence witness is a hand writing and fingerprint expert.
FACTS,"He has proved that the application (exhibit D C) alleged to have been presented to the Naib Tehsildar on the 28th February bore the thumb impression of the appellant, and he has also given evidence to show that certain handwritings which he was asked to compare did not tally."
FACTS,"The evidence given by him with regard to these handwritings has a bearing on the assertion made by the appellant in a petition filed before the committing Magistrate to the effect that the original service report of the process peon showing that the appellant also was one of the persons served for appearance before the Naib Tehsildar on the 28th February, 1949, had been suppressed and another report with forged handwriting had been substituted in its place."
RLC,Both the courts below have held that the alibi has not been proved by satisfactory evidence and that the charges against the appellant have been made 'out.
REASONING,"It seems that the learned Judges of the High Court were not at all impressed by the evidence of Dr. Goyle which they characterized as unsatisfactory and they were not also confident that the gun, exhibit P 16, had been used in causing the injuries to Dalip Singh."
REASONING,"This appears from the folio.wing observations made by them in their judgment: ""The gun P 16 was identified by Jita Singh as the gun with which Mohinder Singh fired at him and Dalip Singh but he identified the gun because of a brass plate at its butt end."
REASONING,We have seen the gun.
REASONING,Its brass plate could be of no use for the identification of the gun.
REASONING,""" Again, commenting on the nature of the injuries, the learned Judges observed as follows : 828 ""Another difficulty which is created in this case is the nature of injuries found on the body of Dalip Singh ."
REASONING,"What kind of bullet it was which, though it had blackened the area where it entered the brain showing that it had been fired from not far away, did not shatter the brain we do not know."
REASONING,What kind of projectile it was which entered the body (which if the evidence as to be believed was fired at from a few feet at Dalip Singh) and passed through the body without shattering the inside of the chest or causing extensive damage therein is also not known.
REASONING,"Mr. Sethi (counsel for the accused) quoted Taylor 's book on medical jurisprudence and Hateher 's book on ballistics and argued that the firing must have been from a place between 600 and 1,200 yards away in order that the projectile may pass through and through the body and not shatter it."
REASONING,"That of course pre supposes that the barrel of the gun, using the word 'gun ' m ' a generic sense, is grooved which causes a projectile to go forward with a rotatory motion of something under a quarter of a million revolutions a minute and travelling at the rate of about 2,000 miles an hour when it leaves the gun . ."
REASONING,We do not know whether the barrel of this gun (exhibit P 16) is grooved or not.
REASONING,is a single bar relled gun and is country made.
REASONING,The likelihood is that the barrel is not grooved.
REASONING,""" On a careful reading of the judgment under appeal, it appears that the learned Judges of the High Court strongly felt that they had no adequate explanation in the oral evidence before them for certain puzzling features of the injuries on Dalip Singh."
REASONING,"This is exactly what we also feel in this case, and it seems to us that the evidence which has been adduced falls short of proof in regard to a very mate rial part of the prosecution case."
REASONING,"in a case where death is due to injuries or wounds caused by a lethal weapon, it has always been considered to be the duty of the prosecution to prove by expert evidence that it was likely or at least possible for the injuries to have been caused with the weapon with which and in the manner in which they are al leged to have been caused."
REASONING,"It is 829 elementary that where the prosecution has a definite or positive case, it must prove the whole of that case."
REASONING,"In the present case, it is doubtful whether the injuries which are attributed to the appellant were caused by a gun or by a rifle."
REASONING,"Indeed, it seems more likely that they were caused by a rifle than by a gun, and yet the case for the prosecu tion is that the appellant was armed with a gun and, in his examination, it was definitely put to him that he was armed with the gun P 16."
REASONING,It is only by the evidence of a duly qualified expert that it could have been ascertained whether the injuries attributed to the appellant were caused by a gun or by a rifle and such evidence alone could settle the controversy as to whether they could possibly have been caused by a fire arm being used at such a close range as is suggested in the evidence.
REASONING,"It is clear, and it is also the prosecution case, that only 2 shots were fired at Dalip Singh and one of the crucial points which the prosecution had to prove was that these shots were fired by two persons and not by one man, and both the shots were fired in such manner and from such distance as is alleged by the eye witnesses."
REASONING,"There is, in our opinion, a gap in the prosecu tion evidence on a most fundamental point and the error which has been committed by the courts below is to ignore the gap and decide the case merely upon the oral evidence of 3 witnesses, two of whom are mere chance witnesses and not altogether independent persons, and the evidence of the third witness is open to criticism on the ground of his partisanship as well as the improbability of his having been able to see the firing at his brother after he had himself been shot at the back of the neck."
REASONING,"The learned Judges of the High Court, after commenting upon the entire evidence, say in their judgment: "" We are thus left with the evidence of the three wit nesses of the prosecution together with the state of wounds as shown by the medical evidence and an unsatisfactory statement of Dr. Goyle."
REASONING,""" 106 830 They reject the evidence of Dr. Goyle and they consider the nature of the wounds to have created a serious dificulty in the case."
REASONING,"Having arrived at these conclusions, it was a serious thing to rest the appellant 's conviction wholly upon the oral testimony in the case which has remained unchecked and unconfirmed by expert evidence."
REASONING,The real position ap pears to be that the prosecution case cannot be said to be wholly proved but only partly proved if it is permissible to use such an expression.
PRECEDENT,"This Court, as was pointed out in Pritam Singh vs The State (1), will not entertain a criminal appeal except in special and exceptional cases where it is manifest that by a disregard of the forms of legal process or by a violation of the principles of natural justice or otherwise substantial and grave injustice has been done."
REASONING,"It seems to us that the present case comes within the rule laid down, because the appellant has been convicted notwithstand ing the fact that the evidence is wanting on a most.material part of the prosecution case."
REASONING,"This is enough to dispose of this appeal, but we are constrained to say that we are not altogether happy about the manner in which the plea of alibi put forward by the appellant has been disposed of by the courts below."
REASONING,"Ordi narily tiffs court will not look beyond the findings of fact arrived at by the courts below, but we find that in the present case the decision on the plea of alibi has been arrived at in disregard of the principle that the standard of proof which is required in regard to that plea must be the same as the standard which is applied to the prosecution evidence and in both cases it should be a reasonable stand ard."
REASONING,"It is common ground in this appeal that the appellant was summoned to appear before the Naib Tehsildar on the 28th February, 1949, which was the date fixed for dealing with Bachittar Singh 's complaint."
REASONING,"Ordinarily and without looking at anything else, there should have been nothing improbable about his appearance before the Naib Tehsildar on that date, but in the present case there is positive (1) 831 evidence that an application for a taccavi loan bearing that date and also bearing the thumb impression the appellant was put up before the Naib Tehsildar and that was dealt with by him on that very day."
REASONING,There is also affirmative evidence of a witness to prove that the appellant was present in the Naib Tehsildar 's court.
REASONING,This witness is undoubtedly closely related to the appellant but his evidence is supported by probability and a written document.
REASONING,"One of the points raised by the prosecution was that the summons for appear ance on the 28th February was not served upon Mohinder Singh, but such evidence as there is on the record bearing on this point has certain peculiar features."
REASONING,The prosecu tion having cited the Naib Tehsildar and the Ahlmad (Bench Clerk) as witnesses in the case gave them up and stated that the former had been won over by the appellant.
REASONING,"This allega tion could have been substantiated in the cross examina tion of the Naib Tehsildar who was examined as a defence witness, but nothing was elicited from him to support such a charge."
REASONING,"From the evidence of the Naib Tehsildar, it appears that on the 5th July, 1949, the Public Prosecutor showed him exhibit P.S. (which is an order directing the appearance of the seven persons including the appellant mentioned by Bachittar Singh in his complaint, before the Naib Tehsildar on the 28th February, 1949)."
REASONING,and that he told the Public Prosecutor that 6 or 7 persons appeared in his court.
REASONING,"After this incident, on the 6th July, 1949, the Public Prosecutor informed the Court that he would ""give up the Naib Tehsildar as he has been won over ""."
REASONING,"The evidence of the process peon is of a somewhat suspicious character, because he has conveniently forgotten every material detail."
REASONING,The appellant asserted at the trial that the original report of the process peon had been suppressed and another report had been fabricated and substituted in its place.
REASONING,"An application to this effect was made by him before the committing Magistrate, and he also examined a handwriting expert to prove some of his allegations."
REASONING,Neither of the courts below has dealt with the evidence 832 of this expert.
REASONING,"The evidence of the Investigating Officer as recorded by the Sessions Judge is to the following effect : ""P.B. and P.C. were obtained by me from the headquar ters."
REASONING,Along with P.B. and P.C. the Parvana P.S. was also received by me.
REASONING,"After going through the zimnis, the witness states that the aforesaid documents P.B., P.C. and P.S. were summoned by the committing Magistrate and were not sent for by the witness."
REASONING,"On 16th March, 1949, a Foot Constable was certainly sent to Zira to bring the said file."
REASONING,"But since the file had been sent to the headquarters, therefore, the said constable returned quite blank."
REASONING,I never inspected this file at the headquarters.
REASONING,""" The most material document with which we are concerned is P.S. which should have contained an endorsement of serv ice of summons on the persons against whom Bachittar Singh had complained."
REASONING,"It is clear from the first part of the evidence of the Investigating Officer that he had received the report of the process peon which was endorsed on the back of P.S., from the headquarters, but he says later that the papers were sent for but they did not arrive."
REASONING,It is surprising that when a document was the subject of so much controversy he should have said by mistake that he had received it.
REASONING,"One of the comments made by the learned Ses sions Judge in dealing with the application alleged to have been made by the appellant on the 28th February, 1949, for a taccavi loan is that after producing the application before the Naib Tehsildar on that date, Mohinder Singh could have reached his village by noon time, but on this point the learned Sessions Judge seems to have wholly ignored the evidence of the Naib Tehsildar that he usually dealt with such applications between 12 and 4 P.M. on working days, and also the affirmative evidence of Joginder Singh."
RPC,"In our opinion, there has been in substance no fair and proper trial in this case, and we are constrained to allow this appeal, set aside the conviction of the appellant under sections 302 and 307 read with section S4 833 of the Indian Penal Code, and direct that he be set at liberty forthwith."
RPC,"In ordinary circumstances, we might have remanded the case for a flesh trial, but we consider that such a course would, in the present case, be unfair and contrary to settled practice, seeing that the appellant has been in a state of suspense over his sentence of death for more than a year."
RPC,Appeal allowed.
NAME,"Mohammad Yasin vs The Town Area ... on 27 February, 1952"
CITATION,"Equivalent citations: 1952 AIR 115, 1952 SCR 572"
COUNSEL,Nuruddin Abroad for the petitioner.
COUNSEL,K.N. Aggarwal for the respondents.
JUDGE,The Judgment of the Court was delivered by DAs J.
FACTS,"This is an application under article 32 of the Constitution made by Mohammad Yasin for the protection of his fundamental right of carrying on his business which, according to him, is being infringed by the respondent."
FACTS,The case sought to be made out in the petition may be shortly stated as follows: The petitioner is a wholesale dealer in fresh vegetables and fruits at Jalalabad in the district of Muzaffarnagar in the State of Uttar Pradesh and claims to have been carrying on such business for the last 7 years or so at his shop situated in the town of Jalalabad.
FACTS,The vegetable and fruit growers used to bring their goods to the town and get them auctioned through any of the vegetable dealers of their choice who used to charge one anna in the rupee as and by way of commission.
FACTS,The respondent Committee which is a Town Area Committee has framed certain bye laws under which all right and power to levy or collect commission on sale or purchase of vegetables and fruits within the limits of the town vest in the respondent Committee or any other agency appointed by the Committee and no one except the respondent Committee is authorised to deal in wholesale vegetables and fruits and collect the commission thereof in any place and in any event.
FACTS,"The respondent Committee has by auction given the contract for sale of 575 vegetables and fruits and for collecting the commission for the current year to the respondent Bishamber who, it is alleged, has never dealt in vegetables and fruits The respondent Committee has not set up any market nor has it framed any bye laws for issue of licences to the vegetable and fruit merchants."
FACTS,The bye laws also provide for prosecu tion for the breach of any of the provisions of these bye laws.
FACTS,"Although, in terms, there is no absolute prohibition against carrying on business as wholesale dealer in vegeta bles and fruits, the result of the bye laws requiring the wholesale dealers to pay the prescribed fee of one anna in the rupee to the contractor who holds the monopoly is, in effect, to bring about a total prohibition of the business of the wholesale dealers in vegetables and fruits."
FACTS,The petitioner contends that by granting a monopoly of the right to do wholesale business in vegetables and fruits to the respondent Bishamber the respondent Committee has in effect totally prevented the petitioner from carrying on his busi ness and has thereby infringed his fundamental right under article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution.
FACTS,"In the alterna tive, the petitioner contends that the respondent Committee has no legal authority to impose a tax of the kind it has sought to do, that the imposition of a tax calculated at one anna in the rupee is in the nature of a sale tax and cannot be regarded as a licence fee and such unauthorised impost constitutes an illegal restraint on his fundamental right under article 19 (1) (g)."
FACTS,The notice of motion has been served on the respondent Committee as well as on respondent Bishamber.
FACTS,"The respond ents have entered appearance and filed an affidavit in opposition to the present application affirmed by their agent on record Paragraph 4 of that affidavit is as follows : ""4."
FACTS,"Paragraphs 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the petition are wrong and misleading and do not convey the correct idea."
FACTS,"If the bye laws are read from beginning to end, the correct posi tion is that the Town Area Committee has lawfully imposed certain taxes on the purchase 576 and sale of fruits and vegetables within the ambit of the Town Area; and instead of collecting the aforesaid taxes departmentally the Committee finds it more convenient and less expensive to auction the 'right to collect the taxes ' and give the contract to the highest bidder or whomsoever it thinks fit and proper."
FACTS,There is absolutely no restriction on anybody who wants to purchase or anybody who wants to sell; only he must pay the prescribed tax to the Town Area Commit tee through the Contractor.
FACTS,"The market is open, and writ large throughout the territory of the Town Area Committee and anybody can purchase from anybody and anybody can sell to anybody, without any control or intervention by the Contractor, whose position is simply that of a taxcollector on behalf of the Town Area Committee."
FACTS,"Instead of getting the pay, he gets the profits, if any, and runs the risk of incurring losses if his gross realisations are less than what he paid."
FACTS,"This is clearly the position, and it is submitted, there is nothing wrong with it legally and no interference of the petitioner 's rights."
FACTS,""" The petitioner has to his petition annexed copies of a set of bye laws dated June 24, 1942, and a copy of a resolu tion of the respondent Committee dated March 16, 1950, recommending the addition of several bye laws to the previ ous bye laws."
FACTS,At the hearing of the petition before us it was agreed by and between counsel on both sides that the petition has to be disposed of on the basis of the bye laws of 1942 only and learned counsel for the respondent Commit tee has produced the original bye laws of 1942 before us.
FACTS,"Bye law 1 only provides that no person shall sell or pur chase any vegetable or fruit within the prescribed limits of the Town Area Committee, Jalalabad by wholesale or auction,without paying the fee fixed under these bye laws to the licensee appointed by the Town Magistrate."
FACTS,Bye law 4 (b) expressly provides that any person can sell in wholesale at any place in the Town Area provided he pays the pre scribed fees to the licensee.
FACTS,"It is, therefore, clear that these byelaws do not in terms, prohibit anybody from dealing in vegetables and fruits as alleged by the petitioner 577 and in this respect they materially differ from the bye laws which this Court had to consider in the Kairana case(1) which consequently does not govern this case."
FACTS,"Learned counsel, however, contends and we think with considerable force and cogency that although, in form, there is no prohibition against carrying on any wholesale business by anybody, in effect and in substance the bye laws have brought about a total stoppage of the wholesale deal ers ' business in a commercial sense."
FACTS,"The wholesale dealers, who will have to pay the prescribed fee to the contractor appointed by auction, will necessarily have to charge the growers of vegetables and fruits something over and above the prescribed lee so as to keep a margin of profit for themselves but in such circumstances no grower of vegetables and fruits will have his produce sold to or auctioned by the wholesale dealers at a higher rate of commission but all of them will flock to the contractor who will only charge them the prescribed commission."
FACTS,"On the other hand, if the wholesale dealers charge the growers of vegetables and fruits only the commission prescribed by the bye laws they will have to make over the whole of it to the contractor without keeping any profit themselves."
FACTS,"In other words, the wholesale dealers will be converted into mere tax col lectors for the contractor or the respondent Committee without any remuneration from either of them In effect, therefore, the bye laws, it is said, have brought about a total prohibition of the business of the wholesale dealers in a commercial sense and from a practical point of view."
REASONING,We are not of opinion that this contention is unsound or untenable.
REASONING,"Learned counsel for the petitioner, however, does not leave the matter there."
REASONING,He goes further and urges that the respondent Committee has no legal authority to impose this fee of one anna in the rupee on the value of goods sold or auctioned and that such imposition is in the nature of a sale tax rather than a licence fee.
REASONING,(1) ; 578 Learned counsel for the respondent in reply takes a preliminary objection to this line of argument.
REASONING,"He points out that as the levying of a tax without authority of law is specifically prohibited under article 265 of the Constitu tion, article 81(1) must be construed as referring to depri vation of property otherwise than by levying of a tax and that levying of a tax in contravention of article 265 does not amount to a breach of a fundamental right."
PRECEDENT,"He contends, on the authority of the decision of this Court in Ramjilal vs Income tax Officer, Mohindargarh(1), that while an ille gal imposition of tax may be challenged in a properly con stituted suit, it cannot be questioned by an application under article 32."
REASONING,This argument overlooks the difference between a tax like the income tax and a licence fee for carrying on a business.
REASONING,"A licence fee on a business not only takes away the property of the licensee but also operates as a restriction on his right to carry on his business, for without payment of such fee the business cannot be carried on at all."
REASONING,"This aspect of the matter was not raised or considered in the case relied on by the learned counsel, and that case, therefore, has no application to the facts of this case."
REASONING,"Under article 19(1) (g) the citizen has the right to carry on any occupation, trade or business which right under that clause is apparently to be unfettered."
REASONING,"The only restriction to this unfettered right is the authority of the State to make a law relating to the carrying on of such occupation, trade or business as mentioned in clause (6) of that article as amended by the Constitution (First Amend ment) Act, 1951."
REASONING,"If therefore, the licence fee cannot be justified on the basis of any valid law no question of its reasonableness can arise, for an illegal impost must at all times be an unreasonable restriction and will necessarily infringe the right of the citizen to carry on his occupa tion, trade or business under article 19 (1) (g) and such infringement can properly be made the subject matter of a challenge under article 32 of the Constitution."
REASONING,(1) [1951] S.C.R.127.
REASONING,579 Learned counsel for the respondents then refers us to the U.P. Town Areas Act (No. 11 of 1914) which governs the respondent Committee.
REASONING,Section 14 of this Act requires the Committee to annually determine and report to the District Magistrate the amount required to be raised in any town area for the purposes of this Act and provides that the amount so determined shall be raised by the imposition of a tax to be assessed on the occupiers of houses or lands within the limits of the town area according either to their general circumstances or to the annual rental value of the houses or lands so occupied by them as the Committee may determine.
REASONING,"There were, at the time when the bye laws of the respond ent Committee were framed, five provisos to this section none of which authorised the imposition of any tax on any business and, therefore, they have no bearing on the ques tion now under consideration."
REASONING,"Learned counsel for the respondents, however, draws our attention to section 38 of the Act which authorises the Provincial Government by noti fication in the Official Gazette to extend to all or any or any part of any town area any enactment for the time being in force in any municipality in the United Provinces and to declare its extension to be subject to such restrictions and modifications, if any, as it thinks fit."
REASONING,"Then he proceeds to draw our attention to Notification No. 397/XI 871 E, dated the 6th February, 1929, whereby, in supersession of all previous notifications, the Provincial Government, in exer cise of the powers conferred by section 38(1) of the United Provinces Town Areas Act, 1914, extended the provisions of sections 293(1) and 298(2) (J) (d) of the United Provinces Municipalities Act (11 of 1916) to all the town area in the United Provinces in the modified form set forth therein."
REASONING,"The original bye laws produced by learned counsel purport, however, to have been framed by the respondent Committee under sections 298 (2)(F)(a)and 294 of the United Provinces Municipalities Act (11 of 1916)."
REASONING,We have not been referred to any notification whereby section '294 580 of the United Provinces Municipalities Act was extended to the respondent Committee.
REASONING,"It appears, however, that the bye laws of the respondent Committee were revised in Septem ber 1942 and were then said to have been made under section 298 (2) (J) (d)."
REASONING,"It will have, therefore, to be seen wheth er these bye laws come within The purview of section 298 (2) (J) (d) as modified in their application to the respondent Committee."
REASONING,It will be noticed that under section 298 (2) (J) (d) as modified as aforesaid the respondent Committee is authorised only to make bye laws fixing any charges or fees or any scale of charges or fees to be paid under section 9.93(1) and prescribing the times at which such charges or fees shall be payable and designating the persons authorised to receive payment thereof.
REASONING,"Section 293(1), as modified, authorises the respondent Committee to charge fees to be fixed by bye laws or by public auction or by agreement for the use or occupation (otherwise than under a lease) of any immovable property vested in, or entrusted to the management of the Town Area Committee, including any public street or place of which it allows the use or occupation whether by allowing a projection thereon or otherwise."
REASONING,Bye law 1 of the respondent Committee to which a reference has already been made forbids a person from using any land within the limits of the town area for the sale or purchase of fruits and vegetables without paying the prescribed fee.
REASONING,"Bye law 4 (b), however, allows any person to sell in wholesale at any place in the town area, provided he pays the prescribed fees to the licensee."
REASONING,These bye laws do not purport to fix a fee for the use or occupation of any immovable property vested in or entrusted to the management of the Town Area Committee including any public street or place of which it allows the use or occupation whether by allowing a projection thereon or otherwise.
REASONING,"Sections 293(1) and 298(2) (J) (d) of the United Province Municipalities Act, 1916, as amended at the time they were extended to the town areas in the United Provinces do not empower the Town Area Committee to make any bye law authorising it to 581 charge any fees otherwise than for the use or occupation of any property vested in or entrusted to the management of the Town Area Committee including any public street."
REASONING,"Therefore, the bye laws prima facie go much beyond the powers con ferred on the respondent Committee by the sections men tioned above and the petitioner complains against the en forcement of these bye laws against him as he carries on business in his own shop and not in or on any immoveable property vested in the Town Area Committee or entrusted to their management."
REASONING,"Learned counsel for the respondent Commit tee, however, urges that the growers of vegetables and fruits come on foot or in carts or on horses along the public street and stand outside the petitioner 's shop and for such use of the public street the respondent Committee is well within its powers to charge the fees."
REASONING,"From the way the case was formulated by the learned counsel, it is quite clear that if anybody uses the public street it is the growers of vegetables and fruits who come to the petition er 's shop to get their produce auctioned by the petitioner and the petitioner cannot be charged with fees for use of the public street by those persons."
REASONING,"In our opinion, the bye laws which impose a charge on the wholesale dealer in the shape of the prescribed fee, irrespective of any use or occupation by him of immoveable property vested in or en trusted to the management of the Town Area Committee includ ing any public street, are obviously ultra vires the powers of the respondent Committee and, therefore, the bye laws cannot be said to constitute a valid law which alone may, under article 19(16) of the Constitution,ofimpose a restric tion on the right conferred by article 19(1) (g)."
REASONING,"In the absence of any valid law authorising it, such illegal impo sition must undoubtedly operate as an illegal restraint and must infringe the unfettered right of the wholesale dealer to carry on his occupation, trade or business which is guaranteed to him by article 19(1) (g) of our Constitution 75 582 In this view of the matter the petitioner is entitled to a suitable order for protection of his fundamental right."
REASONING,"The prayer in the petition, however, has been expressed in language much too wide and cannot be granted in that form."
RPC,The proper order would be to direct the respondent Committee not to prohibit the petitioner from carrying on the busi ness of a wholesale dealer in vegetables and fruits within the limits of the Jalalabad Town Area Committee until proper and valid bye laws are framed and thereafter except in accordance with a licence to be obtained by the petitioner under the bye laws to be so framed.
RPC,The respondent Commit tee will pay the costs of this application to the petition er.

JUDGE,The Judgment of the Court was delivered by CHANDRASEKHARA AIYAR J.
FACTS,"This appeal arises as the result of special leave to appeal granted by this Court on the 1st of May, 1951, against an order of the Madras High Court dated 13th April, 1951, quashing certain proceedings of the Regional Transport Authority, Tanjore, and the Cen tral Traffic Board, Madras, dated 19th January, 1950, and 3rd March, 585 1950, respectively, and an order of the first respondent (the State of Madras) dated 7th November, 1950, and direct ing the issue to Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd., (Petitioners before the High Court) of permits for the five buses in respect of which a joint application had been made original ly by them and one T.D. Balasubramania Pillai."
FACTS,"The present appellant, G. Veerappa Pillai, was the fourth respondent in the High Court."
FACTS,"The present first respondents (Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd.) were the peti tioners before the High Court Present respondents Nos. 2, 3 and 4 were respectively respondents Nos. 1, 2 and 3 before the High Court."
FACTS,"The dispute is between the appellant and Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd., who were competing bus proprietors in the Tanjore District; and it is over the issues of five perma nent permits for buses Nos."
FACTS,"M.D.O. 81, M.D.O. 230, M.D.O. 6, M.D.O. 7 and M. D.O. 759 on the route between Kumbakonam and Karaikal."
FACTS,"It has been a long drawn game with many moves, counter moves, advances and checkmates, both sides display ing unusual assiduity and skill in their manoeuvres for position."
FACTS,"But it is unnecessary to set out in great detail all the steps taken, as they have been narrated in the order of High Court and many of them are of insignificant rele vance for disposal of this appeal."
FACTS,I shall state here only what is material.
FACTS,The 'C ' permits for the five buses stood originally in the name of Balasubramania Pillai.
FACTS,"The buses were agreed to be purchased from him by Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd., and there was a joint application by the transferor and trans feree on 10th March, 1944, for transfer of the ownership and of the 'C ' permits in the name of the purchasers."
FACTS,"Two days later, Veerappa Pillai, proprietor of the Sri Sathi Viias Bus Service, who is the appellant before us, applied for temporary permits to ply two of his own vehicles over the same route, stating that the vehicles of the two agencies which held the permits were mostly out of action."
FACTS,"It was a fact that out of the five buses sold 586 by Balasubramania Pillai, only two were then running; the other three were under repairs."
FACTS,"The permanent permits for the sold buses were suspended by order of the Secretary dated 28th March, 1944."
FACTS,"Temporary permits for buses M.D.O. 920, 894, 918, M.S.C. 7632 and 7482 had been issued to Veerappa Pillai during the same month."
FACTS,Now we come to another chapter in the story.
FACTS,Balasubra mania Pillai resiled from the joint application and repudi ated it as having been got from him by fraud.
FACTS,"The Secre tary, Road Traffic Board, thereupon refused to transfer the ownership on the 19th March, 1944, and this order was con firmed by the Board on 29th May, 1944, Balasubramania Pillai and Veerappa Pillai made a joint application on 10th April, 1944, for transfer of the buses and the original permits in favour of Veerappa Pillai who had on the same date agreed to purchase the vehicles."
FACTS,"The Secretary granted this applica tion on the same date Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd., took the matter before the Central Road Traffic Board and they made an order on 16th August, 1944, upholding the issue of tempo rary permits to Veerappa Pillai for his buses M.D.O. 920, 894,918, M.S.C. 7632 and 7482, but setting aside the trans fer of registry of the original buses and the transfer of the permits relating to the same."
FACTS,"On an application by Veerappa Pillai to review its order dated 16th August, 1944, the Central Road Traffic Board allowed on 27th November, 1944, only the transfer of the ownership of the buses but not a transfer of the permits."
FACTS,"Yet another move in the game was this Veerappa Pillai filed a suit in the court of the Subordinate Judge, Kumbako nam, on 3rd October, 1944, for recovery of possession of the original five buses from Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd., on the strength of his purchase from Balasubramania Pillai."
FACTS,"The Subordinate Judge appointed Veerappa Pillai as Receiver on 17th March, 1945, and the five disputed buses were deliv ered to him on 26th April, 1945."
FACTS,Two of the buses M.D.O. 6 and 7 were repaired by him and put on the route under his temporary permits.
FACTS,"The suit was decreed in 587 his favour on 2nd May, 1946."
FACTS,"Later, he repaired the other three buses M.D.O. 759, 230 and 81 and began to run them on the same route under the temporary permits he held."
FACTS,"Veerappa Pillai was discharged from receivership on 18th September, 1946."
FACTS,"On the strength of the Sub Court decree, Veerappa Pillai again applied for a permanent transfer of the permits, and on 22nd July, 1946, the Central Road Traffic Board trans ferred the petition to the Regional Transport Authority with an intimation that it saw no objection to the issue of regular permits to Veerappa Pillai for the disputed buses or to their transfer in his name, provided there were valid permits in existence."
FACTS,"This view appears to have been modi fied later and on 2nd September, 1946, the Regional Trans port Officer directed the issue of temporary permits to the buses for the period from 3rd September, 1946, to 31st October, 1946, subject to the condition that the issue of the permits did not affect the rights of either party in the matter under dispute."
FACTS,"Thereupon, the Government was moved by Veerappa Pillai and also by Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd., but the Government declined to interfere and the result was an order on 30th June, 1947, by the Regional Transport Authority to the following effect: "" Since the subject matter is on appeal before the High Court, the matter will lie over pending the decision of the High Court."
FACTS,"The temporary permits are continued as is being done."" A fresh petition by Veerappa Pillai to the Central Road Traffic Board, Madras, was unsuccessful, but a further appeal to the Government of Madras ended in his favour in an order dated 29th March, 1949."
FACTS,"The order is in these terms : ""Shri Sathi Viias Bus Service, Porayar, Tanjore dis trict, have been permitted by the Regional Transport Author ity, Tanjore, to run their buses M.D.O. 6, 7, 81, 230 and 750 on the Kumbakonam Karaikal route on temporary permits from 1944 pending 588 the High Court 's decision on the question of permanent ownership of the buses."
FACTS,Government consider it undesirable to keep these buses running on temporary permits for a long and indefinite period.
FACTS,"Further Sri Sathi Vilas Bus Service have secured the decision of the Sub Court, Kumbako nam, in their favour about the permanent ownership of the buses."
FACTS,"In the circumstances the Regional Transport Authori ty, Tanjore, is directed to grant permanent permits for the buses of Sri Sathi Vilas Bus Service, Porayar, referred to above in lieu of the existing temporary permits."
FACTS,""" On the basis of this Government order, permanent permits were issued in favour of Veerappa Pillai on 18th April, 1949."
FACTS,"Getting to know of this last order, Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd.,approached the Government Madras with a petition praying for clarification of the order by making it expressly subject to the decision of the High Court regarding the title to the said five buses and that in the event of the High Court deciding the appeal in favour of Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd. ""the above said five permanent permits will be taken away from Veerappa Pillai and given to them."" The Minister of Transport, who dealt with the matter, stated on the petition ""that was my inten tion also."
FACTS,""" The High Court reversed the decree of the Sub Court on 2nd September, 1949, and came to the conclusion that the title of Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd., to the five buses prevailed over that of Veerappa Pillai."
FACTS,"On 19th September, 1949, they applied to the Government for cancellation of the five permits issued to Veerappa Pillai and for grant of the same to them."
FACTS,"The Government declined to interfere as the Regional Transport Authority was the competent authority, vide order dated 16th November, 1949."
FACTS,"In their application to the Regional 'Fransport Authority dated 28th November, 1949, Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd., asked for withdrawal of the permits."
FACTS,"In the meantime, that is on 14th October, 1949, Veerappa Pillai applied for renewal of his permanent permits held for his own 589 buses Nos."
FACTS,"M.D.O. 1357, 20, 1366, 1110, 1077, M.D.O. 1368 and M.S.C.7632, which had been substituted for the disputed buses as they had become unroadworthy and useless."
FACTS,"The application for renewal has under section 58, sub clause (2), of the Act to be treated as a fresh application for new permits."
FACTS,"This procedure was followed and on 22nd October, 1949, a notification was issued inviting objections against the renewal and giving 30th November, 1949, as the date of hearing."
FACTS,"No objections were received and the Secretary renewed the permits for two years from 1st January, 1950."
FACTS,"This order was dated 3rd January, 1950."
FACTS,"The Regional Trans port Authority dealing with the application of Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd., dated 28th November, 1949, resolved on 19th January, 1950, that the permanent permits issued to Veerap pa Pillai should be cancelled, that the route should be declared vacant in respect of the five buses and fresh applications should be invited and dealt with on the merits."
FACTS,"The order further stated that ""in the meanwhile Sri G. Veerappa Pillai and Raman and Raman will be given temporary permits for running two and three buses respectively on the route."
FACTS,The permanent permits will be cancelled with imme diate effect.
FACTS,Raman and Raman should put in the buses as quickly as possible.
FACTS,Till then Sri Veerappa Pillai will be given temporary permits so as not to dislocate public traf fic.
FACTS,""" Both the parties were dissatisfied with this order and preferred appeals to the Central Road Traffic Board, Madras, which dismissed the appeal of Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd., and restored the permanent permits of Veerappa Pillai by order dated the 3rd March, 1950."
FACTS,"Messrs Raman and Raman Ltd., moved the Government, but it declined to interfere by G.O., dated 7th November, 1950."
FACTS,"Thereupon, Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd., moved the High Court on 4th December, 1950, under article 226 of the Constitution in Civil Miscellaneous Petition No. 12215 of 1950 for a writ of certiorari for quashing the orders and the proceedings of the 590 Regional Transport Authority, the Central Road Traffic Board, Madras, and the State of Madras dated 19th January, 1950, 3rd March, 1950, and 7th November, 1950, respectively, and for the issue of a writ of mandamus or other such appro priate directions to the first respondent to transfer, issue or grant ""the five pucca permits in respect of the route Kumbakonam to Karaikkal to the petitioner herein"" (Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd.) It is on this petition that 'the order challenged in this appeal was made by the High Court."
RLC,"The High Court took the view that throughout all the stages prior to the High Court 's decree, the parties, the transport authorities vested with the power to issue per mits, and the Government also proceeded upon the footing that the transfer of the permits was dependent on the title to the buses and that Veerappa Pillai obtained the temporary and permanent permits only in his capacity as transferee and not in his individual right."
RLC,"To quote the learned Chief Justice:""the conduct of the parties, the attitude of the transport authorities including the Government are all explicable only on the assumption that the rights of parties were consequent on the ownership of the five vehicles in question."
REASONING,The fourth respondent having obtained the benefit of temporary and permanent permits as a transferee from Balasubramania Pillai all this time cannot be heard now to say after the decision of this Court which has negatived his claim and upheld the claim of the applicant that the appli cant should not enjoy the fruits of his success.
REASONING,""" He further points out that the procedure laid down by the Motor Vehi cles Act and the rules for grant of fresh permits was not followed and that long before the application for renewal was allowed, the Regional Transport Authority had been informed of the decision of the High Court."
RPC,"The order of the Central Road Traffic Board was in his opinion most unsatis factory, as it was based on a quibbling distinction between ""withdrawal"" and ""cancellation"" of the permits."
RPC,"In his view, the orders complained against deprived Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd., of the fruits of the 591 decree obtained by them at the hands of the High Court after much expenditure of time and money."
REASONING,"An examination of the relevant sections of the Motor Vehicles Act does not support the view that the issue of a permit for a bus which falls within the definition of a ""stage carriage "" is necessarily dependent on the ownership of vehicle."
REASONING,All that is required for obtaining a permit is possession of the bus.
REASONING,"As ownership is not a condition precedent for the grant of permits and as a person can get a permit provided he is in possession of a vehicle which satisfies the requirements of the statute or the rules framed thereunder, we have to hold that the parties and the authorities were labouring under a misconception if they entertained a contrary view."
REASONING,"But the assumption on which they proceeded may perhaps be explained, if not justified, on the ground that it was supposed that the question of ownership of the vehicles had an important or material bearing on the question as to which of them had a preferen tialclaim for the permits."
REASONING,"It may well be it Was one of the factors to be taken into account and it seems to us that this was apparently the reason why the question of issue of permanent permits was postponed from time to time till we come to the order of the Government dated 29th March, on petitions presented by both the contestants."
REASONING,"If matters had stood as they were till the Government had made this order, something could have been said in favour of Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd., in the event of their ultimate success in the High Court as regards the title to the five buses."
REASONING,But the said order altered the situation.
REASONING,"In the order, the direction for the grant of permanent permits is not rested solely on the decision of the Sub Court in favour of Veerappa Pillai but another reason was also given, namely, that Government considered it undesirable to keep the buses running on temporary permits for a long and indefinite period."
REASONING,"In giving this reason, they were stating a policy."
REASONING,"77 592 As observed already, the High Court by their judg ment dated 2nd September, 1949, reversed the decree of the Subordinate Judge and dismissed Veerappa Pillai 's suit for possession of the buses based on his title."
REASONING,"If it were the law that the question of possession based on ownership was decisive as regards the grant of permits, and if no other circumstances were available to be taken into account when the question of the issue of permanent permits again came up for consideration, it would have been easy to hold that Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd., had at least a preferential claim."
REASONING,"But unfortunately for them, both these requisites are not satisfied."
REASONING,It has been point ed out already that nowhere do we find in the Act anything to indicate that the issue of permits depends on ownership.
REASONING,Other circumstances which had a material bear ing as to which of them was entitled to the permits had come into existence since the date of the original joint application and were taken into account by the transport authorities and by the Government.
REASONING,"The order of 19th January, 1950, of the Regional Transport Authority sought to render rough and ready justice between the par ties by the adoption of what may be called a middle course."
REASONING,The terms of the order have already been set out.
REASONING,"Before disposing of the appeals of both the parties, the Central Traffic Board appears to have called for a report from the Regional Transport Officer."
REASONING,"In this report, attention was drawn to the fact that all the five buses had been replaced by new vehicles and that the registration certificates had been cancelled as a result of the replacement."
REASONING,"After Balasubramania Pillai, it was Veerappa Pillai who was running the buses continuously on this route for nearly 5 years and he also obtained the privilege of securing the permanent permits."
REASONING,"The Central Traffic Board 's order of 3rd March, 1950, restoring the permanent permits of Veerappa Pillai was based on the fact that Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd. asked for withdrawal of the permits and not their cancellation and that no opportunity had been given to Veerappa Pillai to show cause why his permits should not be cancelled; and 593 the procedure prescribed for cancellation was not followed."
REASONING,"When the Government was moved by Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd., under section 64 (a) of the Motor Vehicles Act, they had before them a petition for withdrawal of the perma nent permits issued to Veerappa Pillai and for transfer or grant of five 'pucca permits ' relating to the five buses."
REASONING,The Government granted stay of the appellate order of the Central Road Traffic Board pending disposal of the revision petition 'and called for a report from the subordinate trans port authorities.
REASONING,Two important facts were brought to the notice of the Government in the report Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd. did not file any objections to the renewal of the permits sought by Veerappa Pillai.
REASONING,"What is more important, they had no permits from the French authorities enabling them to run any buses on the portion of the route which lay in French territory."
REASONING,It was further pointed out that there was no subsisting joint application to support the request for transfer and that the original permits in the name of Bala. subramanian had ceased to exist after 31st December 1944.
REASONING,"The Government had also before them two petitions dated 8th March, 1950, and 25th October, 1950, from Messrs Raman and Raman Ltd. and two petitions dated 29th March, 1950, and 8th June, 1950, from Veerappa Pillai."
REASONING,It is on the basis of all these materials that the Government de clined to interfere with the decision of the Central Road Traffic Board.
REASONING,It is contended for the appellant that in this state of affairs the High Court acting under Article 226 of the Constitution had no right to interfere with the orders of the transport authorities.
REASONING,It is unnecessary for the disposal of this appeal to consider and decide on the exact scope and extent of the jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 226.
REASONING,"Whether the writs it can issue must be analogous to the writs of habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto and certiorari specified therein and the power is subject to all the limitations, or restrictions 594 imposed on the exercise of this jurisdiction, or whether the High Court is at liberty to issue any ""suitable directions or orders or writs untramelled ,by any condi tions, whenever the interests of justice so require, is a large and somewhat difficult problem which does not arise for solution now."
ARG,Mr. Setalvad appearing for the appellant urged two narrower grounds as sufficient for his purposes.
ARG,"Firstly, he urged that however wide the jurisdiction of the High Court might be under Article 226, it could never exer cise its powers under the article in such a manner as to convert itself into a court of appeal sitting in judgment over every tribunal or authority in the State discharging administrative or quasi judicial functions."
ARG,"Secondly, he maintained that the Motor Vehicles Act with the rules framed thereunder dealing with the grant of permits is a self contained code and that in respect of the rights and liabil ities created by such a statute the manner of enforcement must be sought within the statute itself."
ARG,"It was further urged by him that in any event, the High Court could not substitute its own view or discretion for the view taken or discretion exercised by the specified authorities, even if it was erroneous or unsound."
REASONING,"Such writs as are referred to in Article 226 are obvi ously intended to enable the High Court to issue them in grave cases where the subordinate tribunals or bodies or officers act wholly without jurisdiction, or in excess of it, or in violation of the principles of natural justice, or refuse to exercise a jurisdiction vested in them, or there is an error apparent on the face of the record, and such act, omission, error, or excess has resulted in manifest injustice."
REASONING,"However extensive the jurisdiction may be, it seems to us that it is not so wide or large as to enable the High Court to convert itself into a Court of appeal and examine for itself the correctness of the decision impugned and decide what is the proper view to be taken or the order to be made Mr. Daphtary, who appeared for the respondent, said nothing to controvert this position."
REASONING,"His argument 595 was that if all along the authorities and the Government had proceeded upon a particular footing and dealt with the rights of the parties on that basis, it was not open to them afterwards to change front and give the go by altogether to the conception of the rights of parties entertained by them till then."
REASONING,"According to him, there was manifest injustice to his client in allowing them to do so and this was the reason which impelled the High Court to make the order which is the subject matter of challenge in this appeal."
REASONING,The Motor Vehicles Act is a statute which creates new rights and liabilities and prescribes an elaborate procedure for their regulation.
REASONING,No one is entitled to a permit as of right even if he satisfies all the prescribed conditions.
REASONING,The grant of a permit is entirely within the discretion of the transport authorities and naturally depends on several circumstances which have to be taken into account.
REASONING,The Regional Transport Authority and the Provincial Transport Authority are entrusted under section 42 with this power.
REASONING,They may be described as administrative bodies exercising quasijudicial functions in the matter of the grant of per mits.
REASONING,Under rule 8 of the Madras Motor Vehicles Rules the Regional Transport Authority is called the Road Traffic Board and the Provincial Transport Authority is called the Central Road Traffic Board.
REASONING,These bodies or authorities are constituted by the Provincial ' Government.
REASONING,The matters which are to be taken into account in granting or refusing a stage carriage permit are specified in section 47.
REASONING,"By delegation under rule 134 A, the Secretary of the Road Traf fic Board may exercise certain powers as regards the grant or refusal of stage carriage permits and under rule 136 there is an appeal to the Board from these orders."
REASONING,Similar powers of delegation are vested in the Secretary to the Central Board and an appeal lies to the Central Board under rule 148(1).
REASONING,"From an original order of the Road Traffic Board there is an appeal to the Central Board and from the original orders of the Central Board to the Government, vide rules 147 and 148 An amendment introduced by the Madras Act XX of 1948 596 and found as section 64 A in the Act vests a power of revi sion in the Provincial Government."
REASONING,"Besides this specific provision, there is a general provision in section 43 A that the Provincial Government may issue such orders and direc tions of a general character as it may consider necessary to the Provincial Transport Authority or a Regional Transport Authority in respect of any matter relating to road trans port; and such transport authority shall give effect to all such orders and directions."
REASONING,"There is, therefore, a regular hierarchy of administrative bodies established to deal with the regulation of transport by means of motor vehicles."
REASONING,"Thus we have before us a complete and precise scheme for regulating the issue of permits, providing what matters are to be taken into consideration as relevant, and prescribing appeals and revisions from subordinate bodies to higher authorities."
REASONING,The remedies for the redress of grievances or the correction of errors are found in the statute itself and it is to these remedies that resort must generally be had.
REASONING,"As observed already, the issue or refusal of permits is solely within the discretion of the transport authorities and it is not a matter of right."
REASONING,We are accordingly of opinion that this was not a case for interference with the discretion that was exercised by the Transport Authorities paying regard to all the facts and the surrounding circumstances.
REASONING,"Further, it will be noticed that the High Court here did not content itself with merely quashing the proceedings, it went further and directed the Regional Transport Authority, Tanjore, ""to grant to the petitioner permits in respect of the five buses in respect of which a joint application was made originally by the petitioner and Balasubramania Pillai and that in case the above buses have been condemned, the petitioner shall be at liberty to provide substitutes within such time as may be prescribed by the authorities."
REASONING,""" Such a direction was clearly in excess of its powers and jurisdic tion."
REASONING,"597 For the reasons given above, the appeal is allowed and the order of the High Court set aside."
RPC,Each party will bear their own costs of these proceedings throughout.
RPC,Appeal allowed.
NAME,"Bathina Ramakrishna Reddy vs The State Of Madras on 14 February, 1952"
CITATION,"Equivalent citations: 1952 AIR 149, 1952 SCR 425"
COUNSEL,"426 S.P. Sinha (S.S. Prakasam, with him), for the appellant."
COUNSEL,"R. Ganapathy Iyer, for the respondent."
JUDGE,The Judgment of the Court was delivered by MUKHERJEA J.
FACTS,"This appeal has come up before us on special leave granted by this court on May 23, 1950, and it is directed against a judgment of a Division Bench of the Madras High Court dated April 10, 1950, by which the learned Judges found the appellant guilty of contempt of court and sentenced him to serve simple imprisonment for three months."
FACTS,"The appellant is the publisher and managing editor of a Telugu Weekly known as ""Praja Rajyam"" which is edited and published at Nellore in the State of Madras."
FACTS,"In the issue of the said paper dated 10th February, 1949, an article appeared under the caption ""Is the Sub Magistrate, Kovvur, corrupt?"" The purport of the article was that Surya Narayan Murthi, the stationary Sub Magistrate of Kovvur, was known to the people of the locality to be a bribe taker and to be in the habit of harassing litigants in various ways."
FACTS,"He was said to have a broker, through whom negotiations in connec tion with these corrupt practices were carried on."
FACTS,"Several specific instances were cited of cases tried by that offi cer, where it was rumoured that he had either taken bribes or had put the parties to undue harassment, because they were obdurate enough to refuse the demands of his broker."
FACTS,"The article, which is a short one, concludes with the fol lowing paragraph: ""There are party factions in many villages in Kovvur Taluk."
FACTS,Taking advantage of those parties many wealthy persons make attempt to get the opposite party punished either by giving bribes or making recommendations.
FACTS,To appoint Magistrates who run after parties for a Taluk like this. . is to betray the public.
FACTS,It is tantamount to failure of justice.
FACTS,"Will the Collector enquire into the matter and allay the public of their fears?"" 427 The attention of the State Government being drawn to this article, an application was filed by the AdvocateGener al of Madras before the High Court on November 14, 1949, under section 2 of the Contempt of Courts Act (Act XII of 1926) praying that suitable action might be taken against the appellant as well as three other persons, of whom two were respectively the editor and sub editor of the paper, while the third was the owner of the Press where the paper was printed."
FACTS,"On receiving notice, the appellant appeared before the High Court and filed an affidavit taking sole responsibility for the article objected to and asserting that the article was published because of his anxiety to uphold the highest traditions of the judiciary in the land and to create popular confidence in courts, the duty of which was to dispense justice without fear or favour and without any discrimination of caste, creed or community."
FACTS,"It was said that before the article was published, numerous complaints had reached him from various quarters imputing corruption and disreputable conduct to this Magistrate and the only desire of the appellant was to draw the attention of the higher authorities to the state of public opinion in the matter and to invite an enquiry into the truth or otherwise of the allegations which were not asserted as facts but were based only on hearsay."
RLC,"The High Court after hearing the parties came to the conclusion that the publication in question did amount to contempt of court, as it was calculated to lower the pres tige and dignity of courts and bring into disrepute the administration of justice."
FACTS,"As the appellant was not prepared to substantiate the allegations which he made and which he admitted to be based on hearsay and did not think it proper even to express any regret for what he had done, the court sentenced him to simple imprisonment for three months."
FACTS,"The other three respondents, through their counsel, tendered unqualified apology to the court and the learned Judges considered that no further action against them was necessary."
RLC,"428 The propriety of the decision of the High Court so far as it relates to the appellant has been challenged before us in this appeal and Mr. Sinha, who appeared in support of the same, raised before us a two fold contention; his first and main contention is that as the contempt in this case was said to have been committed in respect of a court subordi nate to the High Court and the allegations made in the article in question constitute an offence under section 499 of the Indian Penal Code, the jurisdiction of the High Court to take cognizance of such a case is expressly barred under section 2 (3) of the Contempt of Courts Act."
REASONING,"The other contention advanced by the learned counsel relates to the merits of the case and it is urged that in publishing the article objected to, the appellant acted in perfect good faith, and as the article amounted to nothing else but a demand for enquiry into the conduct of a particular person who was believed to be guilty of corrupt practices in the discharge of his judicial duties, there was no contempt of court either intended or committed by the appellant."
REASONING,"So far as the first point is concerned, the determina tion of the question raised by the appellant would depend upon the proper interpretation to be put upon section 2(3) of the Contempt of Courts Act which runs as follows : ""No High Court shall take cognizance of a contempt alleged to have been committed in respect of a court subor dinate to it where such contempt is an offence punishable under the Indian Penal Code."
REASONING,""" According to Mr. Sinha, what the sub section means is that if the act by which a party is alleged to have commit ted contempt of a subordinate court constitutes offence of any description whatsoever punishable under the Indian Penal Code, the High Court is precluded from taking cognizance of it."
REASONING,It is said that in the present case the allegations made in the article in question amount to an offence of defama tion as defined by section 499 of the Indian Penal Code and consequently the jurisdiction of the High Court is barred.
REASONING,Reliance 429 is placed in support of this proposition upon the decision of the Nagpur High Court in Kisan Krishna Ji vs Nagpur Conference of Society of St. Vincent de Paul(1).
REASONING,"This con tention, though somewhat plausible at first sight, does not appear to us to be sound."
REASONING,"In our opinion, the sub section referred to above excludes the jurisdiction of High Court only."
REASONING,in cases where the acts alleged to constitute contempt of a subordinate court are punishable as contempt under specific provisions of the Indian Penal Code but not where these acts merely amount to offences of other description for which punishment has been provided for in the Indian Penal Code.
REASONING,"This would be clear from the language of the sub section which uses the words ""where such contempt is an offence"" and does not say ""where the act alleged to consti tute such contempt is an offence""."
REASONING,"It is argued that if such was the intention of the Legislature, it could have express ly said that the High Court 's jurisdiction will be ousted only when the contempt is punishable as such under the Indian Penal Code."
REASONING,"It seems to us that the reason for not using such language in the sub section may be that the expression ""contempt of court"" has not been used as descrip tion of any offence in the Indian Penal Code, though certain acts, which would be punishable as contempt of court in England, are made offences under it."
REASONING,"It may be pointed out in this connection that al though the powers of the High Courts in India established under the Letters Patent to exercise jurisdiction as Superi or Courts of Record in punishing contempt of their authority or processes have never been doubted, it was a controversial point prior to the passing of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1926, as to whether the High Court could, like the Court of King 's Bench in England, punish contempt of courts subordi nate to it in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction."
REASONING,"The doubt has been removed by Act XII of 1926 which expressly declares the right of the High Court to protect subordinate courts against contempt, but (1) (1943) A.I.R. 1943 Nag."
REASONING,"430 subject to this restriction, that cases of contempt which have already been provided for in the Indian Penal Code should not be taken cognizance of by the High Court."
REASONING,This seems to be the principle underlying section 2(3)of the Contempt of Courts Act.
REASONING,"What these cases are need not be exhaustively determined for purposes of the present case, but some light is undoubtedly thrown upon this matter by the provision of section 480 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which empowers any civil, criminal or revenue court to punish summarily a person who is found guilty of committing any offence under sections 176, 178, 179, 180 or section 228 of the Indian Penal Code in the view or presence of the court."
REASONING,"We are not prepared to say, as has been said by the Patna High Court in Jnanendra prasad vs Gopal(1), that the only section of the Indian Penal Code which deals with contempt committed against a court of justice or judicial officer is section 228."
REASONING,"Offences under sections 175, 178, 179 and 180 may also, as section 480 of the Criminal Proce dure Code shows, amount to contempt of court if the ""public servant"" referred to in these sections happens to be a judicial officer in a particular case."
REASONING,"It is well known that the aim of the contempt proceeding is ""to deter men from offering any indignities to a court of justice"" and an essential feature of the proceeding is the exercise of a summary power by the court itself in regard to the delin quent."
REASONING,"In the cases mentioned in section 480 of the Indian Penal Code, the court has been expressly given summary powers to punish a person who is guilty of offending its dignity in the manner indicated in the section."
REASONING,"The court is competent also under section 482 of the Criminal Proce dure Code to forward any case of this description to a Magistrate having jurisdiction to try it, if it considers that the offender deserves a higher punishment than what can be inflicted under section 480."
REASONING,"Again, the court is enti tled under section 484 to discharge the offender on his submitting an apology, although it has already adjudged him to punishment under section Pat."
REASONING,172. 431 or forwarded his case for trial under section 482.
REASONING,The mode of purging contempt by tendering apology is a further char acteristic of a contempt proceeding.
REASONING,"It seems, therefore, that there are offences which are punishable as contempt under the Indian Penal Code and as subordinate courts can sufficiently vindicate their dignity under the provisions of criminal law in such cases the legislature deemed it proper to exclude them from the jurisdiction of the High Court under section 2(3) of the Contempt of Courts Act;but it would not be correct to ' say that the High Court 's juris diction is excluded even in cases where the act complained of, which is alleged to constitute contempt, is otherwise an offence under the Indian Penal Code."
REASONING,"This view has been taken and, in our opinion quite rightly, in a number of decisions by the Calcutta,(1) Patna,(2) Allahabad(3) and Lahore(4) High Courts."
PRECEDENT,"The only authority which Mr. Sinha could cite in support of his contention is the decision of the Nagpur High Court in Kisan Krishna Ji vs Nagpur Conference of Society of St. Vincent de Paul("")."
REASONING,"The authority is undoubtedly in his favour as it proceeds upon the assumption that the idea underlying the provision of section 2(3) of the Contempt of Courts Act is that if a person can be punished by some other tribunal, then the High Court should not entertain any proceeding for contempt."
PRECEDENT,"It is to be noticed that the learned Judge, who decided this case, himself took the opposite view in the case of Subordinate Judge, First Class, Hoshangabad vs Jawaharlal(6) and definitely held that the prohibition contained in section 2(3) of the Contempt of Courts Act refers to offences punishable as contempt of court by the Indian Penal Code and not to offences punishable otherwise than as contempt."
PRECEDENT,"This decision was neither noticed nor dissented from in the subsequent case, and it is quite possible that (1) Narayan Chandra vs Panehu Pramanik (A.I.R. ; Naresh Kumar.v."
PRECEDENT,Umaromar (A.I.R. 1951 Cal.

PRECEDENT,(4) Bennett Coleman vs G. section Monga (I.L.R. (5) A.I.R. 1943 Nag.
PRECEDENT,(6) A.I.R. 1940 Nag.
REASONING,"56 432 the attention of the learned judge was not drawn to this earlier pronouncement of his, in which case the matter would certainly have been more fully discussed."
PRECEDENT,We think further that the decision of the Calcutta High Court in V.M. Bason vs A. H. Skone(1) which was the basis of the decision of the learned Judge in the subsequent case does not really support the view taken in it.
REASONING,"In the Calcutta case what happened was, that a clerk of the Attorney, who appeared for the respondent decreeholder, went to serve a notice under Order 21, Rule 37(1), of the Civil Procedure Code upon the appellant judgment debtor."
REASONING,The judgmentdebtor refused to take the notice and abused and assaulted the Attorney 's clerk.
REASONING,"Upon that, contempt proceedings were started against him and Mr. Justice C.C. Ghosh, sitting on the Original Side of the High Court of Calcutta, held the appellant guilty of contempt and fined him Rs. 200."
REASONING,"On appeal, this judgment was affirmed by the appellate Bench and there was a general observation made by Chief Justice Sanderson at the close of his judgment that it is not desirable to invoke the special inherent jurisdiction of the High Court by way of proceeding for contempt if ordinary proceedings in a Magistrate 's court are sufficient to meet the requirements of a case."
REASONING,This was not a case under section 2(3) of the Contempt of Courts Act at all and no question either arose or was decided as to whether if an act is otherwise punishable as an offence under the Indian Penal Code the jurisdiction of the High Court under that section would be ousted.
REASONING,"Undoubtedly the High Court had jurisdiction in that case and whether such jurisdiction, which is certainly of a special character and is exercised summarily, should be called in to aid in the circumstances of a particular case would depend upon the discretion of the court."
REASONING,"This has, however, no bearing on the point that has arisen for consideration before us."
REASONING,"We would hold, therefore, that the right view was taken by the learned Judge of the Nagpur High Court in the earlier case and not in the later one, (1) I.L R. 433 It is next urged by Mr. Sinha that even assuming that this view is correct, the language of section 499 of the Indian Penal Code is wide enough to cover a case of contempt of court."
REASONING,"What is said is, that if a libel is published against a judge in respect of his judicial functions, that also is defamation within the meaning of section 499 of the Indian Penal Code and as such libel constitutes a contempt of court, it may be said with perfect propriety that libel on a judge is punishable as contempt under the Indian Penal Code."
REASONING,We do not think that this contention can be accepted as sound.
REASONING,A libellous reflection upon the conduct of a judge in respect of his judicial duties may certainly come under section 499 of the Indian Penal Code and it may be open to the judge to take steps against the libeller in the ordinary way for vindication of his character and personal dignity as a judge; but such libel may or may not amount to contempt of court.
PRECEDENT,"As the Privy Council observed in Surendra Nath Banerjee vs The Chief Justice and Judges of the High Court,(1) ""although contempt may include defamation, yet an offence of contempt is something more than mere defamation and is of a different character."
REASONING,""" When the act of defaming a judge is calculated to obstruct or interfere with the due course of justice or proper administration of law, it would certainly amount to contempt."
REASONING,TIle offence of con tempt is really a wrong done to the public by weakening the authority and influence of courts of law which exist for their good.
REASONING,"As was said by Willmot, C.J.(2) ""attacks upon the judges excite in the minds of the people a general dissatisfaction with all judicial determi nations. and whenever man 's allegiance to the laws is so fundamentally shaken it is the most fatal and dangerous obstruction of justice and in my opinion calls out for a more rapid and immediate redress than any other obstruction whatsoever; not for the sake of the judges as private indi viduals but because they are the channels by which the King 's justice is conveyed to the people""."
REASONING,(1) I.L.R. at 131.
PRECEDENT,(2) Willmot 's Opinions page 256; Rex vs Davies 30 at p. 40 41. 434 What is made punishable in the Indian Penal Code is the offence of defamation as defamation and not as.
REASONING,contempt of court.
REASONING,"If the defamation of a subordinate court amounts to contempt of court, proceedings can certainly be taken under section 2 of the Contempt of Courts Act, quite apart from the fact that other remedy may be open to the aggrieved officer under section 499 of the Indian Penal Code."
REASONING,"But a libel attacking the integrity of a judge may not in the circumstances of a particular case amount to a contempt at all, although it may be the subject matter of a libel pro ceeding."
REASONING,This is clear from the observation of the Judicial Committee in the case of The Matter of a Special Reference from the Bahama Islands(1).
REASONING,"The first contention of Mr. Sinha, therefore, fails."
REASONING,The second point raised by the learned counsel does not appear to us to have any real substance.
REASONING,The article in question is a scurrilous attack on the integrity and honesty of a judicial officer.
REASONING,Specific instances have been given where the officer is alleged to have taken bribes or behaved with impropriety to the litigants who did not satisfy his dishonest demands.
REASONING,"If the allegations were true, obviously it would be to the benefit of the public to bring these matters into light."
REASONING,"But if they were false, they cannot but undermine the confidence of the public in the administration of justice and bring judiciary into disrepute."
REASONING,"The appel lant, though he took sole responsibility regarding the publication of the article, was not in a position to sub stantiate by evidence any of the allegations made therein."
REASONING,He admitted that the statement was based on hearsay.
REASONING,"Ru mours may have reached him from various sources, but before he published the article it was incumbent upon him as a reasonable man to attempt to verify the informations he received and ascertain, as far as he could."
REASONING,whether the facts were true or mere concocted lies.
REASONING,He does not appear to have made any endeavour in this direction.
REASONING,"As the appel lant did not act with reasonable care and caution, he cannot be said to have acted (1) 435 bona fide, even if good faith can be held to be a defence at all in a proceeding for contempt."
REASONING,"What is more, he did not express any regret for what he had done either in the High Court or before us and his behaviour does not show the least trace of contrition."
RPC,"In these circumstances, we think that the appeal cannot succeed and must be dismissed."
RPC,Appeal dismissed.

COUNSEL,Rajani Patel for the respondent.
JUDGE,The judgment of the Court was delivered by MUKHERJEA J.
FACTS,"This appeal is on behalf of the defendant and it arises out of a suit, under section 92 of the Civil Procedure Code, commenced by the plaintiffs who were origi nally nine in number in the court of the District Judge of Kaira at Nadiad."
FACTS,"Out of the nine plaintiffs, only one is surviving, and he is now the sole respondent in this appeal, all the rest having died pending this protracted litigation, which began as early as the year 1928."
FACTS,"The case of the plaintiffs, in substance, was that one Kuberdas, who was a religious teacher and a holy man rounded a cult known as Kaivalya or Karunasagar Panth, the principal tenet of which is that the realization of the Infinite is possible only through the medium of a Guru or spiritual preceptor."
FACTS,Kuberdas received money and lands from his followers and disciples and with this fund he built a temple at Sarsa.
FACTS,"Kuberdas by will appointed his principal disciple Narayandas to succeed him on the Gadi and Narayandas built another and a bigger temple wherein he installed an image of Kuberdas, with the images of two staff bearers on two sides."
FACTS,"The Mahants after Narayandas were Baldevdas, Bhagwandas and Pragdasji, who is the defendant in the suit and each one of them was appointed by a will executed by his predecessor."
FACTS,"The defendant, it is alleged, had been acting in a manner contrary to the usages of the institution and was guilty of incontinence, mismanagement and improper alienation of trust properties."
ARG,On these allegations the plaintiffs prayed that: (1) the properties described in the schedule to the plaint as well as other properties under the management of the defendant be declared to be religious and charitable trust properties of the Kaivalya or Karuna sagar Panth; 515 (2) the defendant be removed from the Gadi and posses sion of the properties and a suitable successor appointed in his place; (3) the defendant be called upon to render accounts for the period of his management; and (4) a scheme might be framed for proper management of the institution.
ARG,The defendant in his written statement traversed all the material allegations in the plaint and contended infer alia that the suit was not maintainable inasmuch as no public trust of a religious and charitable character existed in respect to the suit properties which were the private properties of the defendant himself.
REASONING,"On these pleadings, a number of issues were framed by the District Judge, of which the two following were tried as preliminary issues, viz., (1) Whether the temple and the properties in suit are public charitable properties ? and (2) if not, whether this court has jurisdiction to try the suit ? By his judgment dated the 18th of July, 1935, the Dis trict Judge decided both these issues against the plaintiffs and dismissed the suit."
REASONING,Against this decision the plain tiffs took an appeal to the High Court of Bombay.
REASONING,"The learned Judges of the High Court, who heard the appeal, took the view that the ownership of."
REASONING,"the suit properties was so restricted by the obligation to maintain the institu tion for purposes which only could be described as public charitable purposes, that the suit must be regarded as one coming within section 92, Civil Procedure Code."
REASONING,The result was that the judgment of the trial court was reversed and the case was remanded to that court in order that it might be heard and disposed of on its merits.
REASONING,"The judgment of the High Court is dated 24th of January, 1938."
REASONING,"Being aggrieved by this order, the defendant prayed leave to appeal to the Judicial Committee, but this application was refused."
REASONING,He thereupon filed a petition before the privy Council praying for special leave.
REASONING,516 The Privy Council also refused to grant leave on the ground that the matter was still then in an interlocutory stage.
REASONING,"They, however, said specifically that the order of refusal was without prejudice to the presentation of a fresh peti tion after all the issues were determined."
REASONING,"The case then went back to the trial court and on the evidence adduced by the parties, the District Judge came to the conclusion that the allegations of misconduct and breach of trust made by the plaintiffs were not proved and in this view he dismissed the suit, subject to the declaration already given by the High Court that the temple and the properties in possession of the defendant were public, religious and charitable properties."
REASONING,"The plaintiffs filed an appeal against this decision to the High Court of Bombay and the High Court by its judgment dated 14th of July, 1947, affirmed the decision of the District Judge and dismissed the appeal."
REASONING,"The defendant has now come up to this court on the strength of a certificate granted by the High Court; and though formally it is an appeal against the final decree made by the High Court on 14th of July, 1947, in substance it challenges the propriety of the order of remand passed on 24th January, 1938, by which the High Court reversed the decree of dismissal made by the District Judge and remanded the case, being of opinion that the properties in dispute did appertain to a public trust of a religious and charita ble character."
REASONING,"Mr. Daphtary appearing in support of the appeal has contended before us that on the question as to whether or not a public trust existed in respect of the properties in suit, the view taken by the trial judge was right and that the decision of the High Court is based upon a misapprecia tion of the evidence on the record."
REASONING,We have been taken through the entire evidence by the learned counsel on both sides; but having regard to the view which we propose to take in this case we deem it unnecessary to record any finding as to whether the properties in suit do or do not appertain to a public charitable trust.
REASONING,"In our opinion, after the 517 decision arrived at concurrently, by both the courts below on the merits of the case, it was beyond the scope of a suit framed under section 92, Civil Procedure Code, to give the plaintiffs a bare declaration of this character and make it a part of the decree, although the suit itself was dis missed."
REASONING,"A suit under section 92, Civil Procedure Code, is a suit of a special nature which presupposes the existence of a public trust of a religious or charitable character."
REASONING,"Such suit can proceed only on the allegation that there is a breach of such trust or that directions from the court are necessary for the administration thereof, and it must pray for one or other of the reliefs that are specifically men tioned in the section."
REASONING,"It is only when these conditions are fulfilled that the suit has got to be brought in conformity with the provision of section 92, Civil Procedure Code."
REASONING,"As was observed by the Privy Council in Abdur Rahim vs Barkat Ali(1), a suit for a declaration that certain property appertains to a religious trust may lie under the general law but is outside the scope of section 92, Civil Procedure Code."
REASONING,"In the case before us, the prayers made in the plaint are undoubtedly appropriate to the terms of section 92 and the suit proceeded on the footing that the defendant, who was alleged to be the trustee in respect of a public trust, was guilty of breach of trust."
REASONING,The defendant denied the existence of the trust and denied further that he was guilty of misconduct or breach of trust.
REASONING,"The denial could not certainly oust the jurisdiction of the court, but when the courts found concurrently, on the evidence adduced by the parties, that the allegations of breach of trust were not made out, and as it was not the case of the plaintiffs, that any direction of the court was necessary for proper adminis tration of the trust, the very foundation of a suit under section 92, Civil Procedure Code, became wanting and the plaintiffs had absolutely no cause of action for the suit they instituted."
REASONING,"In these circumstances, the finding of the High Court about the existence of a public trust was wholly inconsequential and as it was (1) (1928) 55 I.A. 96, 67 518 unconnected with the grounds upon which the case was actual ly disposed of, it could not be made a part of the decree or the final order in the shape of a declaratory relief in favour of the plaintiffs."
REASONING,"It has been argued by the learned counsel for the respondents that even if the plaintiffs failed to prove the other allegations made in the plaint, they did succeed in proving that the properties were public and charitable trust properties a fact which the defendant denied."
REASONING,"In these circumstances, there was nothing wrong for the court to give the plaintiffs a lesser relief than what they actually claimed."
REASONING,"The reply to this is, that in a suit framed under section 92 of the Civil Procedure Code the only reliefs which the plaintiff can Claim and the court can grant are those enumerated specifically in the different clauses of t, he section."
REASONING,A relief praying for a declaration that the properties in suit are trust properties does not come under any of these clauses.
REASONING,"When the defendant denies the existence of a trust, a declaration that the trust does exist might be made as ancillary to the main relief claimed under the section if the plaintiff is held entitled to it; but when the case of the plaintiff fails for want of a cause of action, there is no warrant for giving him a declaratory relief under the provision of section 92, Civil Procedure Code."
REASONING,The finding as to the existence of a public trust in such circumstances would be no more than an obiter dictum and cannot constitute the final decision in the suit.
REASONING,"The result is that in our ' opinion the decision of the High Court should stand, but the decree and the concluding por tion, of the judgment passed by the trial court and affirmed by the High Court on appeal shall direct a ' dismissal of the plaintiff 's suit merely without its being made subject to any declaration as to the character of the properties."
REASONING,To this extent the appeal is allowed and the final decree modified.
RPC,The order for costs made by the courts below will stand.
RPC,Each party will bear his own costs in this appeal.

COUNSEL,Gopal Singh for the respondent.
JUDGE,The Judgment of the court was delivered by BOSE J.
FACTS,The main question in this case is whether there is a right of private defence.
FACTS,Most of the facts are not in dispute.
FACTS,"A communal ' riot broke out at Katni on the 5th of March, 1950, between some Sindhi refugees resident in the town and the local Muslims."
FACTS,The trouble started in the locality known as Zanda Bazar or Zanda Chowk.
FACTS,"Police Constable Bharat Singh, P.W. 17, who made the First Information Re port, said that most of the shopkeepers in Zanda Bazar are Sindhis."
FACTS,He stated that when he was to1d that trouble had broken out there he proceeded to the spot and found that the goods in the Muslim shops in that locality were scattered.
FACTS,It is also in evidence that some Muslims lost their lives.
FACTS,"From this place he went on to Subash Chowk, the locality in which the appellant 's shop is situate."
FACTS,It lies to the West of Zanda Bazar.
FACTS,"He states that when he got there he found a ""crowd"" there but not a ""mob""."
FACTS,He admitted that he had said in the First Information Report that a gun was fired a minute after he had reached the spot and he said that what he had stated in the First Information Report was true.
FACTS,"It is not disputed that this shot was fired by the appellant, as also a second shot, and that that caused the death of one man (a Sindhi) and injured three others, also Sindhis."
FACTS,"The map, exhibit D 4, shows that the shops of the appellant and his brother Zahid Khan run into each other and form two sides of a rectangle, the appellant 's house facing north and the brother 's house facing east."
FACTS,Each shop opens out on to a road.
FACTS,"569 It is proved that when the rioting broke out in the Zanda Chowk the alarm spread to the appellant 's locality and the people there, including the appellant, started closing their shops."
FACTS,The appellant 's version is that the mob approached his locality and broke into the portion of the building facing east in which his brother 's shop is situate and looted it.
RLC,The High Court holds that this is proved and holds further that this preceded the firing by the appellant.
RLC,There is a hole in the wall between the two portions of the building in which these two shops are situate and the High Court holds that Zahid 's family got into the appel lant 's portion of the building through this hole and took refuge there.
RLC,The High Court also holds that the appel lant 's mother then told the appellant that the crowd had burst into his (appellant 's) shop and was looting it.
RLC,The learned Judges state that what he said was not quite true because all that the crowd did was to beat the door of the appellant 's shop with lathis as they were passing but had not broken into the shop.
RLC,But they accept the fact that the crowd was beating the doors of the appellant 's shop with their lathis.
REASONING,"In our opinion, the facts found by the High Court are sufficient to afford a right of private defence."
REASONING,Under section 97 of the indian Penal Code the right extends not only to the defence of one 's own body against any offence affecting the human body but also to defending the body of any other person.
REASONING,"The right also embraces the protection of property, whether one 's own or another person 's, against certain specified offences, namely theft, robbery, mischief and criminal trespass."
REASONING,The limitations on this right and its scope are set out in the sections which follow.
REASONING,"For one thing, the right does not arise if there is time to have recourse to the protection of the public authorities, and for another, it does not extend to the infliction of more harm than is necessary for the purpose of defence."
REASONING,"Another limitation is that when death is 570 caused the person exercising the right must be under reason able apprehension of death, or grievous hurt, to himself or to those whom he is protecting; and in the case of property, the danger to it must be of the kinds specified in section 103."
REASONING,The scope of the right is further explained in sec tions 102 and 105 of the Indian Penal Code.
REASONING,Neither the learned High Court Judges nor the Sessions Judge has analysed these provisions.
REASONING,Both Courts appear to be under the impression that actual looting of the appel lant 's shop was necessary before the right could arise.
REASONING,In that they are wrong.
REASONING,"Under section 102 the right of private defence of the body commences ""As soon as a reasonable apprehension of the danger to the body arises from an attempt or threat to commit the offence though the offence may not have been committed."
REASONING,""" Examining the provisions we have set out above, it is evident that the appellant had no time to have recourse to the authorities."
REASONING,The mob or crowd had already broken into one part of the building and was actually beating on the doors of the other part.
REASONING,"It is also evident that the appel lant had reasonable grounds for apprehending that either death or grievous hurt would be caused either to himself or his family learned Sessions Judge has eloquently drawn attention to the lamentable consequences of communal frenzy in India and in Katni in particular, and he refers to the indiscriminate looting of Muslim shops in that town."
REASONING,"So also the High Court holds that "" Looking to the circumstances which had existed in the country before and the fact that the trouble was between the refugees and the local Muslims it cannot be said that there would be no danger to the life of the appellant or at least of grievous hurt if the mob had entered his shop and he prevented it."
REASONING,The apprehension would undoubtedly be reason able.
REASONING,""" And we know that Muslim shops had already been broken into and looted and Muslims killed in the 571 rioting at Zanda Chowk which preceded this, in our opinion, the High Court was wrong in thinking that the appellant had to wait until the mob actually broke into his shop and entered it."
REASONING,"They have emphasised this in another part of their judgment also where they say that the shot was fired "" when there was no looting at the shop and thus no right of private defence."
REASONING,""" It was enough that the mob had actually broken into another part of the house and looted it, that the woman and children of his family fled to the appellant for protection in terror of their lives and that the mob was actually beating at his own doors with their lathis and that Muslim shops had already been looted and Muslims killed in the adjoining locality."
REASONING,"It was impossible for him to know whether his shop would or would not suffer the same fate if he waited, and on the findings it was reasonable for him to apprehend death or grievous hurt to himself and his family once they broke in, for he would then have had the right to protest and indeed would have been bound to do what he could to protect his family."
REASONING,The threat to break in was implicit in the conduct of the mob and with it the threat to kill or cause grievous hurt to the inmates; indeed the High Court Judges themselves hold that his own shop was menaced.
REASONING,The circumstances in which he was placed were amply sufficient to give him a right of private defence of the body even to the extent of causing death.
REASONING,"These things cannot be weighed in too fine a set of scales or, as some learned Judges have expressed it, in golden scales."
REASONING,"We have next to see whether the appellant used more force than was necessary, and here also we cannot use golden scales."
REASONING,He was entitled to cause death and he did not kill more than one man.
REASONING,"He fired only two shots and, as the learned High Court Judges observe, he obviously aimed low."
REASONING,"The High Court holds the mob had moved up to his locality When he fired the shots, so the looting and the beating 572 on the doors were not the isolated acts of a few scattered individuals."
REASONING,"It was the mob that was doing it and in the High Court 's words, ""The very fact that in the town of Katni two shots should have struck four Sindhis and none else shows that the rival community was on the move in that area."
REASONING,""" In our opinion, the appellant did not use more force than was necessary."
REASONING,"Indeed, the firing, far from acting as a deterrent, spurred them on and they ransacked and looted the place."
RPC,We have confined our attention to the right of private defence of the person though in this case the question about the defence of property happens to be bound up with it.
RPC,The appeal is allowed.
RPC,The convictions and sentences are set aside and the appellant will be released.

JUDGE,The Judgment of the Court was delivered by MAHAJAN J.
FACTS,"These appeals are directed against the judgment and decrees of the High Court of Judicature at Calcutta, dated 23rd February, 1945, reversing the judgment and decrees passed by the District Judge of Birbhum dated 16th December, 1938."
FACTS,The principal questions for determina tion are the same in 102 784 all of them and can be conveniently disposed of by one judgment.
FACTS,It is necessary to set out briefly the history of this half a century old litigation I The seven suits out of which arise Appeals Nos.
FACTS,"68 to 74 were filed in September, 1904, by Maharaja Bahadur Singh in the court of the differ ent Munsifs at Rampurhat, against Raja Ranjit Singh Bahadur, deceased, and others, for a declaration of his title to the lands mentioned in the different suits and for mesne profits from the year 1899 till recovery of possession."
FACTS,"It was alleged that the lands in the several suits were chowkidari chakran lands within the plaintiff 's patnidari, granted to his predecessors in interest on 14th November, 1853, by the ancestors of the defendant, that as the lands were in the possession of village watchmen on service tenures, they were excluded from assessment of land revenue and no rent was paid on them, that in the year 1899 under the provisions of sections 50 and 51 of Bengal Act VI of 1870 Government resumed the lands, terminated the service tenures and settled them with the zamindar, that in this situation the plaintiff as patnidar became entitled to their actual physi cal possession, that the zamindar wrongfully took physical possession of them and denied the right of the plaintiff and hence he was entitled to the reliefs claimed."
FACTS,"The suits were decreed on 17th August, 1905, and 19th August, 1905, by the two courts respectively and the decisions were affirmed on appeal by the District Judge."
FACTS,"On special appeal to the High Court, the suits were remanded for trial on the ques tion of limitation, and after remand they were dismissed by the trial court and the Court of appeal as barred by limita tion."
FACTS,"On second appeal, it was held that the suits were within limitation and were then decreed for the second time."
FACTS,This decision was affirmed on appeal to His Majesty in Council.
FACTS,"The plaintiff actually obtained possession of the lands involved in these suits in August, 1913."
FACTS,"An applica tion was made for ascertainment of mesne profits on 785 6th November, 1918."
FACTS,"This was resisted by the defendant and it was pleaded that the plaintiff was not entitled to inter est on mesne profits, that the zamindar was entitled to receive the profits of the disputed lands and that deduc tion should be made out of the amount of the mesne profits on account of munafa and the amount of chowkidari dues as well as cesses due to him or paid by him."
FACTS,"Five years later, on 24th June, 1927, another set of objections was filed by the zamindar claiming deduction out of mesne profits by way of equitable set off of the payments made by him subsequent to the date of delivery possession as well as for the amount of munafa that became payable to him after that date."
FACTS,"After a prolonged enquiry the trial court on 18th December, 1937, decreed the plaintiff 's claim for mesne profits after allow ing the zamindar the deductions claimed by him up to the date of assessment of mesne profits but disallowed the amount claimed by way of equitable set off for the subse quent period."
RLC,"The learned District Judge on appeal reversed this decision and allowed the defendant the amount claimed by him by way of equitable set off, subject, however, to the condition that the dues of the defendant should be deducted from the dues of the plaintiff till the defendant 's dues were wiped off."
RLC,"The relevant part of his judgment runs thus : ""The broad fact is that they (plaintiffs) have been in possession of the lands since 1910 and have been in enjoy ment of rent from the tenants from that date and according to law they are not entitled to possess the land uncondi tionally."
RLC,Now that all the facts are before the court and the time has come for final adjustment of accounts between the parties the court should try to do substantial justice between the parties.
RLC,It is not sufficient answer to say that the plea of equitable set off was not raised in the beginning.
REASONING,The circumstances in all these cases are pecul iar and it could hardly be expected that such plea would have been taken in the very beginning.
REASONING,The course of liti gation in these cases has not run along 786 easy and smooth channels: on the contrary its course has been extremely tortuous and disturbed frequently by con flicting decisions.
REASONING,No one could have reason ably antici pated in the beginning that the litigation would be pro tracted in this extraordinary way.
REASONING,It is the duty of the court to take notice of the subsequent events in order to do justice between the parties .
REASONING,"As we are dealing with the question of equitable set off, no question of time barred debts or unascertained sum can arise ."
REASONING,The plea of equitable set off in respect of time barred debts can be set up as a shield by way of defence nor can any question of payment of court fees arise.
REASONING,"There is, in my opinion, no substantial difference in the character of the respective parties during the entire period and it would be futile to make an attempt at distinction by oversubtle argument where there is really no difference in substance."
REASONING,"There is considerable force in the argument advanced on the side of the appellant, namely, the appellant 's claim to the equitable set off is really in the nature of cross demand arising out of the same transaction and connected in its nature and circumstances ."
REASONING,From whatever standpoint the matter may be looked at I am of the opinion that the claim of the appellant for equitable set off for the subsequent period by way of deduction of the chowkidari revenue and cess paid by him as well as on account of munafa should be allowed.
REASONING,This amount will also carry interest at 6 per cent per annum up to date.
REASONING,The subsequent period means the period since the date of delivery of possession up to 1927 28.
REASONING,""" Against the judgment and decrees of the District Judge the plaintiff preferred appeals to the High Court at Calcut ta."
REASONING,The High Court by the judgment under appeal modified the decrees of the District Judge and disallowed the claim for equitable set off in its entirety for the subsequent period and restored the decree of the trial court.
REASONING,The zamindar filed applications for leave to appeal to His Majesty in Council.
REASONING,These applications were consolidated with similar applications filed in the second batch of suits.
REASONING,A certifi cate 787 was granted for leave to appeal to His Majesty in Council.
REASONING,"By an order dated 9th June, 1947, all the appeals were admitted and it was directed that the proceedings be printed and."
REASONING,transmitted to England.
REASONING,"During the pendency of the proceedings in the High Court, Raja Bhupendra Narayan Singh died and the present appellant was impleaded as his heir and representative."
REASONING,An application was also made in the High Court for permission to urge additional grounds not already taken.
REASONING,After the abolition of the jurisdiction of the Privy Council these appeals were transmitted to this Court.
REASONING,"An application under Order XIX, rule 4, of the Supreme Court Rules was presented at the hearing of the appeals that the appellant be allowed to urge the following additional grounds in support of the appeals, viz. : (1) That the munafa (rent) should not be calculated on the basis of the principles laid down in Radhacharan vs Maharaja Ranjit Singh(1)."
REASONING,(2) That the said munafa should have been assessed on a fair share of the profits from the land.
REASONING,"The second batch of appeals (Nos. 75 to 92 of 1951) arises out of 18 suits instituted in the court of the Munsif of Rampurhat on 22nd December, 1909, by Ganpat Singh and Narpat Singh, predecessors in interest of respondents 1 to 3 against the predecessor in interest of the appellant, late Raja Ranjit Singh Bahadur, and also some other persons who were tenants under him, for a declaration of the plaintiffs ' title to the resumed chowkidari chakran lands and for khas possession of the same and for mesne profits."
REASONING,The allega tions in these suits were the same as in the first set of suits.
REASONING,The defence to the suits was also the same.
REASONING,"The suits were decreed by the trial Judge on 30th September, 1910, in the following terms : ""The plaintiffs ' title is declared to the lands in suit and they will get khas possession of the same by ejecting the tenant defendants; on condition of paying (1) 788 to the defendant No. 1 an additional rent, to be deter mined on the principle that the original patni rent should bear the same ratio to the patni rent now payable by the plaintiffs as the original Hustbood at the time of the creation of the patni should bear to the present increased Hustbood, or any other fair and equitable rent which may be determined at the time of assessing the mesne profits."
REASONING,The plaintiffs will get Wasilat from defendant No. 1 up to the date of delivery of possession of the land in suit to them.
REASONING,"The amount will be determined in a separate enquiry."" The District Judge on appeal remanded the cases for determination of the conditions and terms under which the patnidar was to hold the lands under the zamindar and directed ascertainment of profits."
REASONING,"The plaintiffs ob tained delivery of possession of the lands in the mean while on 23rd November, 1910."
REASONING,"Against the remand order appeals were preferred to the High Court and the High Court decreed the appeals in these terms : ""We set aside the portion of the decision of the Dis trict Judge which remands the cases to the original court to determine the conditions under which the patnidar is to hold the lands under the zamindar."
REASONING,Rest of the remand order will stand.
REASONING,"That portion of the Munsif 's decree, which imposes on the appellant, as a condition of obtain ing khas possession, the payment of additional rent to the zamindar will be set aside."
REASONING,""" Against these decrees appeals were preferred to His Majesty in Council by special leave."
REASONING,"The Privy Council set aside the decrees of the High Court and observed as follows : ""Their Lordships, therefore, see no reason for inter fering with the long series of authorities commencing as far back as the year 1900, which have established the right of the zamindar to have an additional rent fixed for such lands nor can their Lordships overlook the fact that in the cases already referred before this Board no exception was taken by the patnidar to the 789 fixing of such rents as a condition of being put into pos session."
REASONING,""" On 8th December, 1922, the plaintiffs filed applications in these suits for ascertainment of mesne profits for the years 1906 to 1910."
REASONING,"Objections were taken on behalf of the defendant on the 17th April, 1923, and it was contended that the plaintiffs may be allowed mesne profits to the extent of the amount that would be found due after deduction of the amount of rent to which the defendant was entitled in re spect of the lands in suit according to the judgment of the munsif."
REASONING,"On the 28th May, 1927, another application was filed by the zamindar claiming deduction by way of equitable set off of the amounts due to him for rent from 1910 onwards and on account of subsequent payment made by him towards revenue and cesses."
REASONING,"After a prolonged enquiry the munsif ultimately on the 18th December, 1937, decreed the plaintiff 's claim for mesne profits after allowing deduc tions for the amounts claimed by the defendant up to the date of delivery of possession."
REASONING,He held that the appellant was not entitled to get any amount by way of equitable set off in respect of sums of money spent by him in payment of revenue and cesses or for the amount of munafa or profits for the period subsequent to the date of delivery of posses sion.
REASONING,"The District Judge on appeal by his judgment dated the 16th December, 1938, allowed the claim of equitable set off for the period subsequent to delivery of possession and directed that ""from the plaintiffs dues, the dues of the defendant are to be deducted and if after these deduc tions any sum is due to the plaintiffs they will get a decree for that sum."
REASONING,"If it is found on calculations in some cases that the dues of the defendant exceed the dues of the plaintiffs, in such cases the prayer of the plaintiffs for mesne profits must be dismissed."
REASONING,""" Against this decision special appeals were preferred to the High Court and by the judgment under appeal the decision of the trial court was restored."
REASONING,Applications were then made for leave to appeal to His Majesty in Council and 790 those were allowed and a certificate was granted for pre ferring those appeals.
REASONING,Because of the abolition of the jurisdiction of the Privy Council those appeals are now before us for decision.
REASONING,The points for decision in all these appeals are the following : 1.
REASONING,"Whether the appellant is entitled to deduct by way of equitable set off from the amount of mesne profits the amounts due to him on account of rent, revenue and cesses for the period subsequent to the dates of delivery of pos session."
REASONING,"Whether interest should be allowed on the amount of mesne profits found due, and if so, at what rate."
REASONING,"Whether the rent due to the appellant from the patnidar on those funds should be calculated on the basis of annual assets of the land (as in Radhacharan vs Maharaja Ranjit Singh (1), or on a fair and equitable basis."
REASONING,The claim for set off for the period for which mesne profits were claimed has been allowed and is not in these appeals.
REASONING,"As regards the amounts due to the appellant by way of rent subsequent to the date of transfer of possession, the claim is unconnected with the subjectmatter of the different suits."
REASONING,It seems clear that a plea in the nature of equita ble set off is not available when the cross demands do not arise out of the same transaction.
REASONING,Mesne profits due to the plaintiff relate to the period during which the appellant was in wrongful possession of the lands and the amounts claimed by the defendant relate tO a period when he was no longer in possession and had ceased to be a trespasser.
REASONING,No mesne profits are claimable for that period.
REASONING,The right of the appellant to recover additional rents from the plaintiff arises out of a different cause of action and independently of the claim for mesne profits.
REASONING,"If the patnidar after having entered into possession had defaulted in the payment of the (1) (1918)27 C.L J. 532, 791 additional rents due for any period, nothing stood in the way of the appellant from recovering the."
REASONING,in by appropriate legal proceedings.
REASONING,The prolongation of the enquiry for ascertainment of the mesne profits cannot support a claim for equitable set off for the period subsequent to the delivery of possession to the plaintiff.
REASONING,"It is obvious that no claim for equitable set off against mesne profits during the pendency of the suits could be made for the sums deduction of which is now sought, as the amounts had not then accrued due and his right to them had not yet arisen."
REASONING,The learned District Judge was in error in holding that the appellant 's claim for equitable set off was in the nature of a cross demand arising out of the same transaction and connected in its nature and circumstances.
REASONING,"He failed to appreciate that the transaction which led to plaintiff 's demand resulted from the defendant 's wrongful act as a trespasser, while the transaction giving rise to the appellant 's demand arises out of the relationship of landlord and tenant and the obligations resulting therefrom."
REASONING,A wrongdoer who has wrongfully withheld moneys belonging to another cannot invoke any principles of equity in his favour and seek to deduct therefrom the amounts that during this period have fallen due to him.
REASONING,"There is nothing improper or unjust in telling the wrongdoer to undo his wrong, and not to take advantage of it."
REASONING,Such a person cannot be helped on any principles of equity to recover amounts for the recovery of which he could have taken action in due course of law and which for some unexplained reason he failed to take and which claim may have by now become barred by limitation.
REASONING,It was contended that it was only after the decree of the Privy Council that the appellant 's rights to the addi tional rent was finally established and till then no legal steps could be taken to enforce this demand.
REASONING,The contention is without force.
REASONING,The appellant 's right to additional rent had been established by the decree of the trial court in execution of which possession passed from him to the patni dar.
REASONING,The Privy 103 792 Council only affirmed this.decision.
REASONING,The patnidars under the decree were entitled to possession of the lands conditional on payment of the additional rent due for the period they had been out of possession.
REASONING,"That condition having been fulfilled (by adjustment of the appellant 's claim against the mesne profits), the decree must be held to have been satisfied, thus completely settling the cross demands."
REASONING,The landlord 's demand for subsequent rents has to be enforced in the ordinary way in the civil court if any default has been committed in the payment of these rents.
REASONING,This claim cannot for ever remain linked with the demand for mesne profits for any anterior period.
REASONING,The result is that the decision of the High Court on this point is maintained.
REASONING,"On the question of future interest payable on the decretal amount, the learned District Judge observed as follows : ""I may state, however, at this stage that if I were to rule out the fact that I am allowing the claim of the appel lant for equitable set off, I would have allowed interest to the plaintiffs at the uniform rate of 4 per cent."
REASONING,"per annum throughout, i.e., from the beginning of the Washilat period up to date."
REASONING,"As I am allowing the prayer for equitable set off, I am of opinion, however, that interest at the usual rate at 6 per cent."
REASONING,per annum should be granted for the whole of this period.
REASONING,""" The High Court disallowed equitable set off but yet maintained this decision."
REASONING,"When the claim for equitable set off is being disallowed, there is no justification for allowing future interest at the rate of more than four per cent."
REASONING,"for such a long period, particularly in a case where the plaintiff himself has not been prompt in getting, the amount of mesne profits ascertained."
REASONING,The plaintiff did not even ask for an enquiry into this question for a period of about twelve years.
REASONING,Taking into consideration all the circumstances of the case we think that future interest should not have been allowed to the plaintiff in the several suits at a higher rate than four per cent.
REASONING,on the amount decreed in the various Suits by way of mesne profits.
PRECEDENT,793 The appellant 's last contention that the munafa (rent) should not be calculated on the principle laid down in Radhacharan vs Maharaja Ranjit Singh (1) but should have been assessed on a fair share of the profits of the land has no substance because the claim was not made in the grounds of appeal to the Privy Council and was not even mentioned in the additional grounds of appeal.
REASONING,It was for the first time made before us at the hearing and we see no valid grounds for entertaining it at this late stage.
REASONING,"Moreover, it seems to us that the claim has no substance in the absence of any evidence about the proportion the original patni rent bore to the revenue and cesses."
REASONING,For the reasons given above all these appeals fail except to the extent that the decree of the High Court is modified in that the amounts decreed by way of mesne profits in the various suits will bear interest at the rate of four per cent.
REASONING,instead of six per cent.
RPC,The parties will bear their own costs in all these appeals.
RPC,Appeals dismissed.

JUDGE,The Judgment of the Court was delivered by MUKHERJEA J.
RLC,"This appeal is directed against an appellate judgment of a Division Bench of the Madras High Court dated November 27, 1945, reversing the decision of the Subordinate Judge of ' Mayuram made in Original Suit No. 34 of 1943."
FACTS,There is no dispute about the material facts of the case which lie within a short compass and the controversy centers round one point only which turns upon the construction of a will left by one Kothandarama Ayyar to whom the properties in suit admittedly belonged.
FACTS,"Kothandarama, who was a Hindu inhabitant of the District of Tanjore and owned considerable properties, died on 25th April 1905, leaving behind him as his near relations his adoptive mother Valu Ammal, his widow Parbari and two daughters Nagammal and Gnanambal, of whom Nagammal,who became a widow during the testator 's life time had an infant daughter named Alamelu Kothandarama executed his last will on 13th March, 1905, and by this will, the genuineness of which is not disputed in the present litigation, he gave an authority to his widow to adopt unto him a son of his second daughter Gnanambal, should she beget one before January., 1908, or in the alter native any of the sons of his two nephews, if the widow so chose."
FACTS,"The suit, out of which the appeal arises, was commenced by Raju Ayyar, who was a son of the testator 's nephews and was taken in adoption by the widow in terms of the will; and it was for recovery of possession of certain properties, known as Kothangudi properties which formed part of the testator 's estate on the allegation that under the will mentioned above, these properties were given to Nagarnmal, the wid owed daughter of the testator for her life time, but as there was no disposition of the remaining interest after the death of the life tenant, the properties vested in the 952 plaintiff as the adopted son and heir of the deceased on the death of Nagammal which took place on 3rd of January, 1943."
FACTS,"Gnanambal, the second daughter of the testator, was the first and main defendant in the suit, and she resisted the plaintiff 's claim primarily on the ground that there was no intestacy as regards the suit properties after the termina tion of the life interest of Nagammal, and that under the terms of the will itself she was entitled to get these properties in absolute right after the death of Nagammal, subject to payment of a sum of Rs. 5,000 to Alamelu, the daughter of Nagammal."
FACTS,"Alamelu was made the second defendant in the suit and as she died when the suit was pending in the trial court, her heirs were impleaded as defendants 3 to 9."
RLC,The first court accepted the contention of the defendant No. 1 and dismissed the plaintiff 's suit.
RLC,"On appeal to the High Court, the judgment was reversed and the plaintiff 's claim was allowed."
FACTS,The defendant No. 1 has now come up appeal to this court.
FACTS,"To appreciate the contentions that have been raised by the parties to this appeal, it would be convenient first of all to refer briefly to the relevant provisions of the will: After cancelling his previous wills."
FACTS,"the testator in the third paragraph of his will, gave his widow authority to adopt a son."
FACTS,"She was to adopt the son of Gnanambal, if the latter got a son previous to January 1908, or she could adopt any of the sons of the testator 's nephews."
FACTS,"Paragraph 4 provides that if the first course is followed, that is, if the son of Gnanambal is adopted by the widow, then all the properties, movable and immovable, belonging to the testator excepting the village of Kothangudi, the house at Injigudi and the other properties which were disposed of by the will would go to such adopted son."
FACTS,"Paragraph 5, which is materi al for our present purposes runs as follows:. ""The whole village of Kothangudi and the house at Injigudi, both of Nannilam Taluk, my daughter Nagammal, shall enjoy with life interest and after her the said property shall pass to my daughter Gnanambal and her chil dren on payment by the latter of Rs. 5,000 to Alamelu Nagam mal 's daughter."
FACTS,""" 953 By the sixth paragraph the Nallathukudi and Pungavur villages together with certain house property at Mayavaram are given to the testaor 's adoptive mother and wife in equal shares to be enjoyed by both of them during their life time and after their death they are to pass on to the adopted son."
FACTS,Paragraph 7 gives a small h.use absolutely to Nagammal for her residence and paragraph 8 makes certain provisions for management of the properties.
FACTS,In paragraph 9 direction is given to collect the money due on the insurance policy on the life of the testator and to pay off his debts.
FACTS,"Pragraph 10 mentions certain charities, the expenses of which are to be derrayed from the income of the Nallathukudi properties."
FACTS,"Paragraph 11 then says that in the event of the widow adopt ing any of the nephew 's sons of the testator, such son shall inherit the entire property at Kokkur and also the lands of Nallathukudi after the death of the testator 's wife and mother."
FACTS,"By paragraph 12, the village of Maruthanthanallur is given to Gnanambal and paragraph 13 provides that ""the village of Kothangudi shall be enjoyed by Nagammal as stated in paragraph 5"" By paragraphs 15 and 16 the remainder in the house at Mayavaram situated in the east row of Vellalar kovil Street is given to Gnanambal after the death of the testator 's wife and mother."
FACTS,Paragraph 18 provides for cer tain other charities.
FACTS,"In paragraph 20 it is stated that if the wife of the testator should die before January, 1908, without making any adoption, then the eldest or any son of Gnanambal would be his adopted son without any formality and inherit all the properties subject to the conditions men tioned in the will."
FACTS,"Paragraph 21, which is the penultimate paragraph in the will, further lays down that if all the three contingencies fail and no adoption is taken, the male child or children born to Gnanambal shall inherit as grand sons all the properties of the testator, subject to the conditions specified in the will."
FACTS,"These, in brief, are the dispositions made in the will."
FACTS,"The plaintiff founds him claim upon paragraph 13 of the will which, according to him, contains the enire disposition so far as the Kothangudi 954 property is concerned."
FACTS,That village is given to Nagarm mal for her life with no disposition of the remaining inter est.
FACTS,"If the remainder has not been disposed of, there is no doubt that the plaintiff would be entitled to the property as the heir of the testator under the ordinary law of inher itance."
FACTS,The defendant No. 1.
FACTS,"on the other hand, relies on para graph 5 of the will, which gives the Kothangudi village and the Injigudi house to Nagammal to he enjoyed by her so long as she lives and after her death they are to go to Gnanambal and her children subject to the payment of a sum of Rs. 5,000 to be paid to Alamelu, the daughter of Nagammal."
RLC,"The High Court on a construction of the will has found in favour of the plaintiff primarily on the ground that in the contingency which happened in the present case, viz., that the widow took in adoption a nephew 's son of the testa tor, paragraph 5 of the will did not come into operation at all."
FACTS,"The disposition as regards Kothangudi property is, therefore, to be found exclusively in paragraph 13 of the will and the actual words employed by the testator in that paragraph do not indicate that apart from Nagammal 's taking a life estate in the Kothangudi village the rest of the provisions in regard to this property as laid down in para graph 5 would also be incorporated into paragraph 13."
RLC,"An Obvious difficulty, according to the learned Judges, in accepting the construction sought to be put upon the will by defendant No. 1 is that paragraph 5 speaks both of Kothan gudi and Injigudi properties, whereas paragraph 13 does not mention the Injigudi house at all, nor does it purport to give a life interest in the same to Nagammal."
FACTS,"It could not be reasonably held on a construction of the will that the intention of the testator was that Gnanambal was to pay Rs. 5,000 to Alamelu for the Kothangudi property alone."
RLC,The result was that the plaintiff 's claim was allowed.
FACTS,It is the propriety of this decision that has been challenged before us in this appeal.
ARG,"In course of the arguments, we have been referred by the learned Counsel on both sides to quite a large 955 number of decided authorities, both English and Indian, in support of their respective contentions."
REASONING,"It is seldom prof itable to compare the words of one will with those of anoth er or to attempt to find out to which of the wills upon which decisions have been: given in reported cases, the will before us approximates closely."
REASONING,Cases are helpful only in so far as they purport to lay down certain general princi ples of construction and at the present day these general principles seem to be fairly well settled.
REASONING,The cardinal maxim to be observed by courts in constru ing a will is to endeavour to ascertain the intentions of the testator.
REASONING,This intention has to be gathered primarily from the language of the document which is to be read as a whole without indulging in any conjecture or speculation as to what the testator would have done if he had been better informed or better advised.
PRECEDENT,"In construing the language of the will as the Privy Council observed in Venkata Narasimha vs Parthasarathy (1), ""the courts are entitled and bound to bear in mind other matters than merely the words used."
PRECEDENT,"They must consider the surrounding circumstances, the position of the testator, 'his family relationship, the probability that he would use words in a particular sense, and many other things which are often summed up in the somewhat picturesque figure 'The court is entitled to put itself into the testator 's armchair ' ."
REASONING,"But all this is solely as an aid to arriving at a right construction of the will, and to ascertain the meaning of its language when used by that particular testator in that document."
REASONING,"So soon as the con struction is settled, the.duty of the court is to carry out the intentions as expressed, and none other."
REASONING,The court is in no case justified in adding to testamentary dispositions.
REASONING,"In all cases it must loyally carry out the will as properly construed, and this duty is universal, and is true alike of wills of every nationality and every religion or rank of life."" A question is sometimes raised as to whether in constru ing a will the court should lean against (1) 42 I.A. 51 at p.70."
REASONING,956 intestacy.
REASONING,The desire to avoid intestacy was considered by the Privy Council in the case referred to above as a rule based on English necessity and English habits of thought which should not necessarily bind an Indian court.
REASONING,"It seems that a presumption against intestacy may be raised if it is justified by the context of the document or the surrounding circumstances; ""but it can be invoked only when there is undoubted ambiguity in acertainment of the intentions of the testator."
PRECEDENT,"As Lord Justice Romer observed in Re Edwards; Jones vs Jones (1), ""it cannot be that merely with a view to avoiding intestacy you are to do otherwise than construe plain words according to their plain meaning""."
REASONING,It is in the light of the above principles that we should proceed to examine the contents of the will before us.
REASONING,"The present will, which is the last of four testamentary document executed by the testator, appears to have been prepared with a great deal of care and circumspection."
REASONING,The testator had clearly in mind the different situations that might arise in case his widow adopted either Gnanambal 's son or a son of one of the nephews of the testator.
REASONING,He envis aged also the possibility of the widow dying without making any adoption at all.
REASONING,"Besides the son to be adopted, the only other relations who had natural claims upon the affection and bounty of the testator and for whom he desired to make provisions were his wife, his adoptive mother, the two datughters and the infant grand daughter."
REASONING,"The interests given to his wife, the adoptive mother and the eldest daugh ter, who were all widows, were for their life time, except a small house property which was given absolutely for the residence of the eldest daughter."
REASONING,"On the other hand., the bequests in favour of Gnanambal, who was a married daughter, and the adopted son of the testator, were absolute in their character."
REASONING,"Besides these dispositions, there were certain gifts for charity which were to be met out of the income of the properties given to the wife and the adoptive mother for their lives."
REASONING,One singular feature (1) [1906]1 Ch. 570 at p. 574. 957 in the will is that the testator took scrupulous care to include in it every item of property that he owned.
REASONING,There are two provisions in the will relating Kothan gudi property to which the dispute in the present suit relates.
REASONING,"One is in paragraph 5 which gives this property along with the house at Injigudi to Nagammal, the remainder being given to the appellant subject to the payment of a sum of Rs. 5, 000 to Alamelu, the daughter of Nagammal."
REASONING,"The other is in paragraph 13, which merely says that Nagammal was to get it for life as stated in paragraph 5."
REASONING,The view taken by the High Court and which has been pressed for our acceptance here by the learned Counsel for the respondents is that paragraph 5 was meant to be operative only if Gna nambal 's son was adopted by the widow.
REASONING,"As that was not done, paragraphs 4 to 8 of the will, it is urged, will go out of the picture alttgether and it is not permissible to refer to them except to the extent that they were impliedly incorporated in the subsequent paragraphs of the will."
REASONING,We do not think that this is the correct way of reading the document.
REASONING,The testator undoubtedly contemplated different contingencies; but a reading of the whole will does not show that he wanted to make separate and self contained provisions with regard to each of the contingencies that might arise and that each set of provisions were to be read as exclusive of the other set or sets.
REASONING,That does not appear to be the scheme of the will.
REASONING,"The testator 's main desire undoubtedly was that his widow should adopt the son of his daughter Gnanambal, and in the first part his will after making provisions for his two daughters, his wife and adoptive mother and also for certain charities, he left the rest of his properties to the son of Gnanambal that was to be adopted by his widow."
REASONING,"In the second part of the will, which is comprised in paragraphs 11 to 16, the testator sets out the modifications which he desires to make in the earli er dispositions in case a son of one of his nephews was adopted by the widow."
REASONING,"It was not the intention of the testa tor that on the happening of the second contingency, all 958 the earlier provisions of the will would stand cancelled and the entire dispositions of the testator 's property would have to be found within the four corners of paragraphs 11 to 16 of the will."
REASONING,"In our opinion, the provisions made for the two daughters, the widow and the adoptive mother as made in paragraphs 5, 6 and 7 of the will and also the provisions for charities and payment of debts contained in paragraphs 9 and 10 were meant to be applicable under all the three contingencies referred to above."
REASONING,"This is clear from the fact that provisions of paragraphs 7, 9 and 10 have not been repeated or incorporated in paragraphs 11 to 16, although it cannot be suggested that they were not to take effect on the happening of the second contingency."
REASONING,"Again in the third contingency contemplated by the testator, which is described in paragraph 20, it is expressly stated that if no adoption is made, the eldest or any son of Gnanambal would inher it the properties and he shall take the properties subject to the conditions mentioned in the will."
REASONING,"The conditions spoken of here undoubtedly refer to the provi sions made for the mother, wife and the two daughters of the testator as well as in respect to payment of debts and carrying out of the charities specified in paragraph 10."
REASONING,The changes that are to take effect on the happening of the second event are in regard to the bequests in favour of the adopted son.
REASONING,"Under paragraph 4 of the will, the adopted son was to get all the p. roperties of the testator with the exception of those given to the two daughters, the mother and the wife."
REASONING,"Under paragraph 11, if the adoption is of a nephew 's son of the testator, the adopted son gets only the Kokkur properties and the reversionary interestin Nallathukudi village after the death of the testator 's wife and mother."
REASONING,The village Maruthanthanallur which would go to the adopted son under paragraph 4 is taken away under para graph 11 and is given to Gnanambal.
REASONING,She is also given the remaining interest in the Mayavaram house which was given to the adopted son under paragraph 6.
REASONING,"Subject to the changes thus made, the provisions 959 of paragraphs 5, 6 and 7 would, in our opinion, still remain operative even if the person adopted was a nephew 's son of the testator."
REASONING,No change is made in paragraphs 11 to 16 with regard to the provision in paragraph 5 of the will.
REASONING,In paragraph 13 it is only stated that the village Kothangudi shall be enjoyed by Nagammal as stated in paragraph 5.
REASONING,"It may be conceded that this statement by itself does not let in the entire provision of paragraph 5, but that is not material for our present purpose."
REASONING,It is enough that para graph 5 has not been changed or altered in any way.
REASONING,"The statement in paragraph 13 may, after all, be a loose expres sion which the testator used only for the purpose of empha sising that the Kothangudi village would be enjoyed by Nagammal even if Gnanambal 's son was not adopted."
REASONING,"This is not by way of making any new disposition, but only to affirm what has been already done."
REASONING,The affirmation of a portion of the provision which is perfectly superfluous cannot exclude the rest.
REASONING,"It is somewhat difficult to say why the rest of the provisions in paragraph 5, particularly the benefit that was meant to be given to Alamelu, was not repeated in para graph 13."
REASONING,It may be that the testator did not consider it necessary or it may be that it was due to inadvertance.
REASONING,It is to be noted here that the testator did not mention any where in paragraphs 11 to 16 the small house that was given absolutely to Nagamreal under paragraph 7.
REASONING,It was certainly not the intention of the testator that Nagammal would not have that house on the happening of the second contingency.
REASONING,If paragraph 5 itself is held to be applicable and in our opinion it should be so held there is no question of adding to or altering any of the words made use of by the testator.
REASONING,It is not a question of making a new will for the testator or inventing a bequest for certain persons simply because the will shows that they were the objects of the testator 's affection.
REASONING,The provision is in the will itself and it is only a question of interpretation as to whether it is ap plicable in the circumstances which have happened in the present case.
REASONING,"The position, therefore, seems 960 to be that the disposition made in paragraphs 5, 6 and 7, which were in favour of the mother, the wife and the two daughters of the testator were meant to take effect immedi ately on the testator 's death."
REASONING,They were not contingent gifts in the sense of being made dependent upon the adoption of Gnanambal 's son by the wife of the testator.
REASONING,"Only the reversionary interest in the Mayavaram house, which was to vest in the adopted son under the provision of paragraph 6 after the death of the widow and the mother was taken away from the adopted son and given to Gnanambal in case the person adopted was not her own son."
REASONING,If the whole of para graph 5 remains operative the Injigudi house must also be deemed to have been given to Nagammal for her life and in fact the evidence is that she enjoyed it so long as she was alive.
REASONING,"No difficulty also arises regarding the payment of Rs. 5,000 to Alamelu as has been stated by the High Court in its judgment."
REASONING,"Having regard to the meticulous care with which the testator seems to have attempted to provide for the differ ent contingencies that might arise and the anxiety displayed by him in making an effective disposition of all the proper ties he owned, it is not probable that he would omit to make any provision regarding the future devolution of the Kothan gudi village if he really thought that such direction had to be repeated in the latter part of the will."
REASONING,"The omission of the gift of Rs. 5,000 to Alamelu also cannot be explained on any other hypothesis."
RPC,It is not necessary for the purpose of the present case to invoke any rule of presumption against.
RPC,"intestacy, but if the presumption exists at all, it certainly fortifies the conclusion which we have arrived at."
RPC,"The result is that the appeal is allowed, the judgment and decree of the of the High Court are set aside and those of the Subordinate Judge restored."
RPC,The appellant will have costs of all the courts.
RPC,Appeal allowed.

COUNSEL,"M.C. Setalvad, Attorney General for India, (B. Sen, with him) for the respondent."
JUDGE,The Judgment of the court was deliv ered by CHANDRASEKHARA AIYAR J.
FACTS,"This appeal, preferred ch from the decree of the Bombay High Court in Appeal No. 281 of 1947, raises the question whether an execution application seeking to execute a final decree, passed by the let Class Subordinate Judge 's Court at Poona, on 6th December, 1932, for a sum of Rs. 1,24,215 and odd, is barred by limitation."
FACTS,The decree was made in a suit for dissolution of a partner ship and the taking of accounts.
FACTS,"854 The execution application was filed on 4th October, 1946, and the amount stated to be due under the decree on that date was Rs. 2,30,986 and odd."
FACTS,"The previous execution application No 946 of 1940 filed in the Court of the 1st Class Sub Judge, Sholapur, to which the decree had been transferred for execution, was made on 24th June, 1940."
FACTS,"It was dismissed on 9th September, 1940, for non prosecution."
FACTS,It would thus be seen that the present application was filed after the lapse of 12 years from the date of the final decree and 3 years from the date of the final order on the previous application.
FACTS,"To surmount the bar of limitation, the decree holder, who is the appellant before us, raised four contentions:firstly, that the final decree, which provided that the plaintiff should pay the deficit court fees on the decretal amount before the execution of the decree, was a conditional decree, and that time began to run from the date when the condition was fulfilled on 5th Decem ber, 1935, by payment; secondly, that the period occupied by the insolvency proceedings from 10th August, 1937, to 14th December, 1942, initiated by the decree holder to get the first judgment debtor Walchand Ramchand Kothari (with whom alone we are now concerned) adjudged an insolvent, should be excluded under section 14 (2) of the Limitation Act; third ly, that the period occupied by one Tendulkar, who was the creditor of the present decree holder, in seeking to execute this decree, should be deducted; and lastly, that as the judgment debtor prevented execution of the decree against the 'Prabhat ' newspaper by suppressing his ownership of the same, a fresh starting point of limitation springs up in the decree holder 's favour from the date of the discovery of the fraud."
FACTS,"The Subordinate Judge held that the execution applica tion was not barred, agreeing with every one of these con tentions."
RLC,"On appeal to the High Court Chagla C.J. and Dixit J. reversed this decision, holding that it was not a condi tional decree, that the steps taken by Tendulkar to execute this decree were of no avail, and that the insolvency pro ceedings were for a 855 different relief altogether, so that section 14 (2) of the Limitation Act could not be invoked."
RLC,"They concurred with the finding of the Subordinate Judge that the judgment debtor prevented the execution of the decree within 12 years by fraudulent concealment of his ownership of the 'Prabhat ' newspaper and that the twelve years ' bar of limi tation did not apply; but they held that the application was barred under article 182 of the Limitation Act, as more than three years had run from 9th September, 1940, the date of the dismissal of the previous execution application, before the present application was filed on 4th October, 1946."
FACTS,The decree was not a conditional one in the sense that some extraneous event was to happen on the fulfilment of which alone it could be executed.
FACTS,The payment of court fees on the amount found due was entirely in the power of the decree holder and there was nothing to prevent him from paying it then and there; it was a decree capable of execu tion from the very date it was passed.
FACTS,There could be no exclusion of the time occupied by the insolvency proceedings which clearly was not for the purpose of obtaining the same relief.
FACTS,The relief sought in insolvency is obviously differ ent from the relief sought in the execution application.
REASONING,"In the former, an adjudication of the debtor as insolvent is sought as preliminary to the vesting of all his estate and the administration of it by the Official Receiver or the Official Assignee, as the case may be, for the benefit of all the creditors; but in the latter, the money due is sought to be realized for the benefit of the decree holder alone, by processes like attachment of property and arrest of person."
REASONING,"It may be that ultimately in the insolvency proceedings the decreeholder may be able to realize his debt wholly or in part, but this is a mere consequence or result."
REASONING,Not only is the relief of a different nature in the two proceedings but the procedure is also widely divergent.
REASONING,The steps taken by the appellant 's creditor Tendulkar to attach this decree and put it in execution do not save limitation.
REASONING,"His darkhast for attachment of the 856 present decree was on 3rd April, 1940, and for execution of the present decree was on 1st February, 1944, more than 3 years from 9th September, 1940, which is the date of the dismissal of the appellant 's prior execution petition."
ARG,The learned Advocate for the appellant therefore devot ed most of his argument to the fourth contention set forth above.
FACTS,"That the judgment debtor respondent suppressed his ownership of the 'Prabhat ' newspaper and fraudulently pre vented the execution of the decree against this property has been found by both the Courts below, as stated already."
FACTS,"It was strenuously urged that the fraud so found is not merely fraud as broadly interpreted under section 48 (2), Civil Procedure Code, but also strict or concealed fraud within the meaning of section 18 of the Limitation Act."
FACTS,"In this connection, it is as well to set out very briefly the nature of the concealment and the steps taken by the judgment debtor to achieve the same."
FACTS,He purchased the 'Prabhat ' newspaper with all its assets and goodwill from its previ ous owner one Purushottam Mahadev in 1938 under the letter marked Exhibit 129.
FACTS,"He opened current accounts in several banks, and gave the name of one Abhyankar as the owner of the paper, but he was himself operating on those accounts."
FACTS,"One Rajwade, a friend of the judgment debtor, was shown as the printer and publisher of the paper."
FACTS,"Even in his supplementary written statement flied in Court in answer to the present execution, marked Exhibit 88 (page 53 of the printed book), the defendant asserted in paragraph 2 that he became the owner of the newspaper only in April,/944, and that previously he had no ownership or right in the same."
FACTS,He did not go into the witness box to refute the allegation that he was the owner ever since the purchase of the paper in 1938 and that he opened accounts in the names of other people on which he was operating for his own benefit.
FACTS,"On these facts, the Subordinate Judge found as follows : ""I think on the whole that the evidence establish es beyond doubt that the judgment debtor had concealed his proprietary interest in his newspaper called 857 Prabhat ' from June, 1938, to April, 1944."
FACTS,The only purpose for which the property could have been concealed in this way was probably the fear that the decree holder would pounce upon it if he came to know about it.
FACTS,"The decree holder came to know of this fraud after April, 1944; for thereafter the judgment debtor made an open declaration that the newspaper belonged to him."
FACTS,I think therefore that this fraud has prevented the decree holder from executing the decree against some property of the judgment debtor.
FACTS,""" In this finding, the High Court concurred."
RLC,"After referring to the stratagem adopted by the judgment debtor in Bhagu Jetha vs Malick Bawasaheb(1), the learned Judges observed: ""In this case, in our opinion, the stratagem is much more dishonest."
RLC,"The attempt on the part of the judgment debtor was to conceal his property, to deny its ownership and to put forward a mere benamidar as the real owner of that property."
RLC,"In our opinion, therefore, the execution of the decree is not barred under section 48."
FACTS,"The 'judgment debtor has, by fraud, prevented the execution of the decree within 12 years before the date of the application for execution by the decree holder and therefore the decree under consideration is capable of being executed."
ARG,""" On the strength of this concurrent finding, Mr. Krish naswami Iyengar for the appellant argued that the fraud fell within the scope of section 18 of the Limitation Act and that if it were so, he was out of the woods, inasmuch as the proper article to apply would be article 181 of the/imita tion Act."
ARG,"The right to apply accrued to him when the fraud became known to him in or about June, 1946. 'Till then he was kept by the fraud from the knowledge of his right to make an application against the property."
REASONING,"Law does not require him to make futile successive applications in execu tion, in the face of this fraud."
FACTS,"He was not in a position to seek even the arrest of the judgment debtor as he had got himself declared in the insolvency proceedings as agriclu turist."" within the meaning of the Deccan (1) I.L.R. 110 858 Agriculturists ' Relief Act."
FACTS,alleging falsely that he was not in receipt of any income by way of salary or remuneration from the newspaper concerned and that he was mainly depend ent on the income of his family lands for his maintenance.
STATUTE,There can be no question that the conduct of the re spondent was fraudulent within the meaning of section 48 (2) of the Civil Procedure Code.
REASONING,"Though benami transactions are common in this country and there is nothing per se wrong in a judgment debtor purchasing property in another man 's name, we have to take into account all the circumstances attending the purchase and his subsequent conduct for find ing out whether it was part of a fraudulent scheme on his part to prevent the judgment creditor from realizing the fruits of his decree."
REASONING,Fraudulent motive or design is not capable of direct proof in most cases; it can only be in ferred.
REASONING,The facts before us here leave no room for doubt that the true object of the judgmentdebtor was to prevent the execution of the decree against the ' Prabhat ' news paper Which he had purchased.
REASONING,"Other persons were shown as the printer and the publisher of the newspaper, while Abhy ankar was mentioned as the proprietor, The judgement debtor, was, however, operating on those accounts for his own benefit."
REASONING,"In the Insolvency Court, he set up the plea that he was an agriculturist, by suppressing the truth about his ownership of the paper, and pretending that his income was mainly, if not solely, from the family lands."
REASONING,"He kept up this show till April 1944, when probably he felt that he was sale from the reach of the judgment creditor."
REASONING,"Even in his answer to the execution application, out of which this appeal has arisen, he had the hardihood to assert that he was not the owner of the paper till April 1944."
REASONING,"It should also be remembered that he did not get into the witness box to explain what other necessity there was for all this camouflage, except it be to cheat the appellant of his dues under the decree."
ARG,"Mr. Setalvad, the learned Attorney General, who appeared for the respondent, pointed out that there 859 was no benami purchase and that the holding out of Abhyankar as the proprietor of the ' Prabhat ' did not amount to any false representation or misrepresentation to the judgment creditor, as the accounts on which reliance was placed were accounts opened in the banks and were not ordinarily avail able for inspection by third parties."
REASONING,"This line of reasoning is hardly convincing, when we have to consider whether what is attributed to the judgment debtor does not amount to a fraudulent scheme or device for preventing execution of the decree that had been passed against him for a very large sum of money."
REASONING,"In the very nature of things, fraud is secret in its origin or inception and in the means adopted for its success."
REASONING,"Each circumstance by itself may not mean much, but taking all of them together, they may reveal a fraudulent or dishonest plan."
REASONING,"It would be convenient to set out here in extenso sec tion 48, Civil Procedure Code, and section 18 of the Limita tion Act before we proceed to consider the soundness of the arguments advanced by both sides in support of the positions they have taken up."
STATUTE,"Section 48, Civil Procedure Code (which corresponds to section 230 of the Code of 1882), is in these terms: "" 48."
STATUTE,"(1) Where an application to execute a decree not being a decree granting an injunction has been made, no order for the execution of the same decree shall be made upon any fresh application presented after the expiration of 12 years from (a) the date of the decree sought to be executed, or (b) where the decree or any subsequent order directs, any payment of money or the delivery of any property to be made at a certain date or at recurring periods the date of the default in making the payment of delivery in respect of which the applicant seeks to execute the decree."
STATUTE,"(2) Nothing in this section shall be deemed (a) to preclude the Court from ordering the executior of a decree upon an application presented after the expiration of the said term of twelve years, where the 860 judgment debtor has by fraud or force prevented the execu tion of the decree at some time within twelve years immedi ately before the date of the application; or (b) to limit or otherwise affect the operation of arti cle 183 of the first Schedule to the Indian Limitation Act, 1908."
STATUTE,""" Section 18 of the Limitation Act, 1908, runs thus: "" 18."
STATUTE,"Where any person having a right to institute a suit or make an application has, by means of fraud, been kept from the knowledge of such right or of the title on which it is founded, or where any document necessary to establish such right has been fraudulently concealed from him, the time limited for instituting a suit or making an application (a) against the person guilty of the fraud or accessory thereto, or (b) against any person claiming through him other wise than in good faith and for a valuable consideration, shall be computed from the time when the fraud first became known to the person injuriously affected thereby, or, in the case of the concealed document, when he first had the means of producing it or compelling its production."" Whether the fraud of the judgment debtor should actually prevent the execution of the decree or whether it is enough if the fraud has been committed without esulting in actual prevention is a question on which there has been some diver gence of opinion in the decided cases."
PRECEDENT,The former view was taken in an early Madras case Kannu Pillay vs Chellathammal and ) Others(1) and receives support from the decision reported in Sri Raja Venkata Lingama Nayanim Bahadur Varu and Another vs Raja Inuganti Rajaopala Venkata Narasimha Rayanim Bahadur Varu and five Others(2)to which our learned brother Mr. Justice Patanjali Sastri was a party.
PRECEDENT,The latter view ( (1) [1898] M.I.J. Mad.
PRECEDENT,861 is indicated in M.R.M.A.S.P. Ramathan Chefliar vs Mahalingam Chetti(1) by a Bench of which Sir Madhavan Nair J. was a member.
PRECEDENT,"It is not necessary to determine which view is correct, as we have here definite findings of both the Courts below that there was fraud preventing the execution of the decree within the meaning of Section 48 of the Civil Procedure Code."
PRECEDENT,The appellant thus escapes the bar of the 12 years ' period and he has a fresh starting point of limitation from the date of the fraud for section 48 of the Civil Procedure Code.
REASONING,"In other words, the decree holder has another 12 years within which he can execute his decree."
PRECEDENT,"Having thus got over the difficulty in his way under section 48 of the Code of Civil Procedure, he has next to meet the objection under the Limitation Act."
PRECEDENT,"On behalf of the appellant, it was urged that section 18 of the Limita tion Act applied to the facts and that the right to apply accrued to the appellant when the fraud by the judgment debtor became known to him in 1946."
PRECEDENT,No reliance was placed on section 18 of the Limitation Act in the courts below and no reference to it is found in the grounds of appeal to this court.
PRECEDENT,It is however mentioned for the first time in the appellant 's statement of the case.
PRECEDENT,"If the facts proved and found as established are sufficient to make out a case of fraud within the meaning of section 18, this objection may not be serious, as the question of the applicability of the section will be only a question of law and such a question could be raised at any stage of the case and also in the final court of appeal."
PRECEDENT,The following obser vations of Lord Watson in Connecticut Fire Insurance Co. vs Kavanagh (2) are relevant.
PRECEDENT,"He said: ""When a ques tion of law is raised for the first time in a court of last resort upon the construction of a document or upon facts either admitted or proved beyond controversy, it is not only competent but expedient in the interests of justice to entertain the plea."
PRECEDENT,"The expediency of (1) 1.L.R. (2) 862 adopting that course may be doubted when the plea cannot be disposed of without deciding nice questions of fact in considering which the court of ultimate review is placed in a much less advantageous position than the courts below."" Mr. Setalvad, however, urged that the appellant should not be allowed to rely on section 18 now for the first time and that even if fraud within the meaning of that section had been pleaded the respondent might have adduced counter evidence by himself going into the witness box or otherwise."
PRECEDENT,"According to him, the approach to the question of fraud under section 18 of the Limitation Act is quite different from the approach under section 48 of the Civil Procedure Code."
REASONING,"There may be cases where the fraud alleged and found is fraud in the wider sense of the term within the meaning of section 48 (2) of the Civil Procedure Code, but the same facts do not amount to fraud as strictly construed under section 18 of the Limitation Act."
REASONING,"The fact that the decree holder in the lower courts relied on section 48, Civil Procedure Code, only does not prevent him from relying on section 18 of the Limitation Act if the facts necessary to be established for bringing in the assistance of section 18 of the Limitation Act are admitted, or proved."
REASONING,It is not disputed that the fraud contemplated by section 18 of the Limitation Act is of a different type from the fraud contem plated by section 48 (2) of the Civil Procedure Code.
REASONING,"The wording of section 18 which requires the fraud ""to prevent knowledge of the right to make the application"" is neces sarily of a different nature from the fraud which prevents the decree holder from making an application for execution."
REASONING,"Conceding to the appellant the right to rely on section 18 of the Limitation Act even at this late stage, let us see if it is really of any help to him on the facts found."
REASONING,The section has been quoted already.
REASONING,It speaks of the right to institute a suit or make an application which by means of fraud has been kept from the knowledge of the person having the right or the title on which it is founded.
REASONING,"The right to apply for 863 execution of a decree like the one before us is a single and indivisible right, and not a composite right consisting of different smaller rights and based on the decree holder 's remedies to proceed against the person of the judgment debtor or his properties, moveable and immoveable."
REASONING,"Togive such a meaning would be to split up the single right into parcels and to enable the decree holder to contend that while his right to proceed against a particular item of property is barred, it is not barred in respect of other items."
REASONING,We would then be face to face with different periods of limitation as regards one and the same decree.
REASONING,An inter pretation which leads to this result is prima facie un sound.
REASONING,"Both sides agreed that this is the true position, but they reached it from slightly varying standpoints."
REASONING,"According to the appellant, fraud even with reference to one property gives him a further extension of 12 years under section 48 (2) as regards the whole decree and it is not necessary for him to show that he had proceeded against the other properties of the judgment debtor."
REASONING,"According to the respondent, the fraud must consist in the concealment of the knowledge of the decree holder 's right to apply for execution of the decree and it is not enough to prove or establish that the fraud prevented him from ' proceeding against a specific item."
REASONING,"The two contentions, lead to the same conclusion about the indivisibility of the decree, but along different lines."
REASONING,"In our opinion, the facts necessary to establish fraud under section 18 of the Limitation Act are neither admitted nor proved in the present case."
REASONING,"Concealing from a person the knowledge of his right to apply for execution of a decree is undoubtedly different from preventing him from exercising his right, of which he has knowledge."
STATUTE,Section 18 of the Limitation Act postulates the former alternative.
REASONING,To read it as referring to an application for execution to proceed against a particular property would be destructive of the oneness of the decree and would lead to multiplicity of periods of limitation.
STATUTE,"It is true that articles 181 and 182 of the Limitation Act and section 48, 864 Civil Procedure Code, should be read together."
REASONING,The articles expressly refer to the section.
REASONING,"But they are independent or parallel provisions, different in their scope and object."
PRECEDENT,As held in Kalyanasundaram Pillai vs Vaithilinga Vanniar (1) section 48 (2) extends the 12 years ' period of closure by a further period of similar duration but the necessity of resort to article 182 is not thereby obviated.
REASONING,The decree holder must have been taking steps to keep the decree alive and the only circumstance that could relieve him of this obligation is the existence of fraud under section 18 of the Limitation Act.
ARG,"The learned Advocate of the appellant asked how it could be possible for him to apply in execution when there was the fraud and whether the law contemplated that, even though the fraud prevented execution of the decree, he was to go on filing useless or futile applications every three years merely for keeping the decree alive."
REASONING,"The fraud pleaded namely suppression of owner ship of the 'Prabhat ' newspaper, did not conceal from him his right to make an application for execution of the de cree."
REASONING,"Indeed, the suppression, which began in 1938, did not prevent the decree holder from applying for execution in 19 10; and in his answers in cross examination, he has adimitted that there were other properties to his knowledge against which he could have sought execution, viz., deposits in several banks of the judgment debtor 's monies but stand ing in his wife 's or daughter 's names, life insurance poli cies for which premia were being paid by him, law books written and published by him, movable properties in the house at Poona etc."
REASONING,"As a matter of fact, the appellant 's present application seeks execution against several of these properties."
REASONING,"Nothing prevented him therefore ,from seeking such execution within 3 years of the dismissal of his prior application in 1940."
REASONING,"Even with reference to the 'Prabhat ', all that the decree holder states is that as he had no evidence to prove that the concern belonged to the defendant he did not take any steps, and not that he had no (1) I,L.R. 1939 Mad.611 865 knowledge of the ownership."
REASONING,"To quote two sentences from his deposition: ""I had suspected that defendant No. 1 was the real owner of the business all the while."
REASONING,"But I had no posi tive knowledge or information till 1946"" . . ""I could not take any step for attaching the defendant 's business till 1946 as I had no evidence to prove the defendant 's fraud till then."
REASONING,""" There is no obligation on the judgment debtor to post the decree holder with all details of his properties; it is the decree holder 's business to gather knowledge about the properties so that he can realise the fruits of his decree."
REASONING,"In dealing with this evidence, Mr. Krishnaswami lyengar relied on the Privy Council decision, Rahimbhoy vs Turner in 20 I.A. 1 and referred to the following observation of Lord Hobhouse at page ""But their Lordships consider, and in this they agree with both the Courts below, that all that the appellant Rahimbhoy has done is to show that some clues and hints reached the assignee in the year 1881, which perhaps, if vigorously and acutely followed up, might have led to a complete knowledge of the fraud, but that there was no disclosure made which informed the mind of the assignee that the insolvent 's estate had been defrauded by Rahimbhoy of these assets in the year 1867."
REASONING,""" The passage cited does not apply here because the appellant admits knowledge, which is more than a mere suspicion, but states that he had no evidence to prove the defendant 's ownership."
REASONING,"In any event, it has not been established within the meaning of section 18 of the Limitation Act that the fraud alleged and proved kept back from him the knowledge of his right to execute the decree."
REASONING,It is thus clear that the appellant cannot get the benefit of section 18 of the Limitation Act.
REASONING,"It was next argued on behalf of the appellant that under section 48(2) of the Civil Procedure Code, because of the fraud of the respondent the appellant got a fresh starting point of limitation for the Limitation Act also 111 866 and therefore the starting point contemplated in the third column of the schedule to the Limitation Act relating to applications for execution should be the date when the fraud was discovered by the appellant."
REASONING,"In other words, it was argued that the effect of section 48 was not merely to make the 12 years ' period start from the discovery of fraud for the purpose of section 48(2) of the Civil Procedure Code but also to give a fresh starting point for the schedule to the Limitation Act."
REASONING,This argument cannot be accepted.
REASONING,"If a man is prevented from making an application, because of the fraud of the debtor, he is not necessarily prevented from knowing his right to make the application."
REASONING,"By the enactment of section 18, the Legislature has distinctly contemplated that for the Limitation Act the starting point is changed on the ground of fraud, only when the knowledge of the right to make the application is prevented by the fraud of the judg mentdebtor."
REASONING,"Having the knowledge that he had the right to make the application, if the judgment debtor prevents the decree holder from knowing the existence of certain properties against which the decree could be enforced, the case is clearly not covered by the words of section 18 of the Limitation Act."
REASONING,Therefore the argument advanced on behalf of the appellant is unsound.
REASONING,It was urged that the various starting points mentioned in the third column to article 182 of the Limitation Act cannot apply because none of them specify a fresh starting point for execution acquired on the ground of the fraud of the judgment debtor.
REASONING,"This argument, in our opinion, instead of helping the appellant, goes against him."
REASONING,Such a provision in the third column in the article relating to execution of decrees is not necessary because provision for such a con tingency is made in section 18.
REASONING,"Affirmatively, by the inclu sion of section 18 in the Limitation Act, and, negatively, by not providing for a separate period of limitation in the case of the fraud of the judgment debtor in the third column in the articles, the Legislature has clearly indicated that unless advantage could be taken by the 867 decree holder under section 18 on the ground of the fraud of the judgment debtor, fraud does not give any other relief under the Limitation Act."
REASONING,This scheme of the Legislature is not inconsistent with section 48 of the Civil Procedure Code.
REASONING,The two provisions in the two Acts have to be read as related to the same subject but dealing with two differents aspects.
REASONING,"Without section 48 of the Civil Procedure Code a decree holder, if he made applications as required by arti cle 181 or 182 of the Limitation Act, could keep his decree alive for an indefinite period."
REASONING,"The Legislature, as a matter of policy, ruled that a decree of a civil court (but excluding the High Court) shall not be kept alive for more than 12 years, although all necessary steps are taken under the Limitation Act to keep the decree alive and operative."
REASONING,That is one limit to the right of the decree holder to enforce the decree of the court.
REASONING,"The second limitation to his right, which is independent of the first, is that he must keep the decree alive under article 182 or 181, as the case may be."
REASONING,In the case of the fraud of the judgment debtor provision is made in section 48(2) for enlarging the 12 years period prescribed under section 48.
REASONING,"For defeating the plea of the bar of limitation under the Limitation Act, in the case of fraud of the judgment debtor, provision is found in section 18 of the Limitation Act."
REASONING,"If the particu lar case of fraud set up and proved is not covered by those words, there is no protection against the same in the Limi tation Act."
REASONING,"Read in that way, the two legislative provi sions are neither conflicting nor overlapping; and they are capable of operating harmoniously, as they deal with different situations and circumstances."
REASONING,"The argument ad vanced on behalf of the appellant that because of the fraud he got not merely a fresh starting point for computing the 12 years period prescribed in section 48 ( '2,) of the Civil Procedure Code but is also entitled to an extension of the time under the Limitation Act, must therefore fail."
REASONING,"The second contention urged on behalf of the appellant that because in the third column of article 182 868 fraud is not mentioned, the case is covered by article 181 does not also appear to be sound."
STATUTE,The third column in article 182 prescribes the starting point of limitation under different specified circumstances.
STATUTE,"It does not, and indeed need not, mention the ground of fraud because if fraud of the kind against which the Limitation Act contem plates relief, as prescribed in section 18 of the Limitation Act, is established, the time is automatically altered by operation of that section."
REASONING,"If the case does not fall under that section, no relief is permitted under the Limitation Act and the starting point for computing the period must be as mentioned in the third column, irrespective of the question of fraud."
STATUTE,"In our opinion, therefore, the conten tion that because of the fraud established in the present case under section 48(2) of the Civil Procedure Code, the appellant gets a fresh starting point of limitation under article 182 of the Limitation Act is unacceptable."
REASONING,"The appellant relied on the general principle of juris prudence that fraud stops or suspends the running of time and that it should be applied in his favour, apart from section 18 of the Limitation Act."
REASONING,Rules of equity have no application.
REASONING,where there are definite statutory provisions specifying the grounds on the basis of which alone the stoppage or suspension of running of time can arise.
REASONING,"While the courts necessarily are astute in checkmating or fighting fraud, it should be equally borne in mind that statutes of limitation are statutes of repose."
RPC,For the reasons given above we concur in the conclusion reached by the High Court and dismiss the appeal with costs.
RPC,Appeal dismissed.
