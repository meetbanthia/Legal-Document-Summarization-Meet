CITATION,"Equivalent citations: 1950 AIR 165, 1950 SCR 553 "
CITATION,Appeal No. LXVI of 1949. 
STATUTE,"Appeal from the High Court of judicature, Bombay, in a reference under section 66 of the Indian Income tax Act, 1022. "
COUNSEL,"K.M. Munshi (N. P. Nathvani, with him), for the appel lant. ' M.C. Setalvad, Attorney General for India (H. J. Umrigar, with him), for the respondent. 1950."
JUDGE,The judgment of the Court was delivered by MEHR CHAND MAHAJAN J.
RLC,This is an appeal against a judgment of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay in an income tax matter and it raises the question whether munici pal property tax and urban immoveable property tax payable under the relevant Bombay Acts are allowable deductions under section 9 (1) (iv) of the Indian Income tax Act. 
STATUTE,Deduction of these two sums was claimed under the provisions of section 9 the Act.
RLC,"Out of the first item a deduction in the sum of Rs. 48,572 was allowed on the ground that this item represented tenants ' burdens paid by the assessee, otherwise the claim was disallowed"
RLC,The High Court answered all the three questions in the negative and hence this appeal.
STATUTE,"The decision of the point depends firstly on the construction of the language employed in sub clause (iv) of sub section (1) of section 9 of the Act, and secondly, on a finding as to the true nature and character of the liability of the owner under the relevant Bombay Acts for the payment of these taxes. "
STATUTE,"Before the amending Act of 1939, clause (iv) contained only the first, third and fourth sub clauses. "
ARG,It is this sub clause which the appellant invokes in support of its claim to deduction of the municipal and urban property taxes in the present case. 
STATUTE,"Section 143 of the City of Bombay Municipal Act, 1888, authorises the levy of a general tax on all buildings and lands in the city. "
STATUTE,The primary responsibility to pay this property tax is on the lessor (vide section 146 of the Act). 
STATUTE,In order to assess the tax provision has been made for the determination of the annual rateable value of the building in section 154. 
STATUTE,"Section 156 provides for the maintenance of an assessment book in which entries have to be made every official year of all buildings in the city, their rateable value, the names of persons primarily liable for payment of the property tax on such buildings and of the amount for which each building has been assessed."
STATUTE,These sections lay down a procedure for hearing objections and complaints against entries in the assessment book. 
STATUTE,"Sections 143to 168 concern themselves with the imposition, liability and assessment of the tax for the year."
STATUTE,""" Section 197 provides that each of the property taxes shall be payable in 559 advance in half yearly instalments on each first day of April and each first day of October. "
STATUTE,"Finally section 212 provides as follows : ""Property taxes due under this Act in respect of any building or land shall, subject to the prior payment of the land revenue, if any, due to the provincial ,Government thereupon, be a first charge . . upon the said build ing or land . "" It creates a statutory charge on the building. "
STATUTE,"Urban immove able property tax is leviable under section 22 of Part VI of the Bombay Finance Act, 1932,on the annual letting value of the property. "
STATUTE,Section 24 (2) (b) is in terms similar to section 212 of the Bombay Municipal Act. 
STATUTE,"For the purposes of section 9 of the Indian Income tax Act both these taxes, namely, the munici pal property tax as well as the urban immoveable property tax are of the same character and stand on the same footing."
ARG,"Mr. Munshi, the learned counsel for the appellant con tended that both the taxes are assessed on the annual value of the land or the building and are annual taxes, although it may be that they are collected at intervals of six months for the sake of convenience, that the income tax itself is assessed on an annual basis, that in allowing deductions all payments made or all liabilities incurred during the previ ous year of assessment should be allowed and that the taxes in question fell clearly within the language of section 9 (1) (iv). "
ARG,"The learned Attorney General, on the other hand, argued that although the taxes are assessed for the year the liability to pay them arises at the beginning 560 of each half year and unless a notice of demand is issued and a bill presented there is no liability to pay them and that till then no charge under section 212 of the Act could possibly arise and that the liability to pay being half yearly in advance, the charge is not an annual charge. "
ARG,It was also suggested that the taxes were a capital charge in the sense of the property being security for the payment.

JUDGE,The Judgment of the Court was deliv ered by PATANJALI SASTRI J.
RLC,"The High Court was of opinion that, on a proper construction of the terms of the compromise, it did not fall under clause (d)."
RLC,"Mano har Lall J., who delivered the leading judgment, observed: ""It was a tripartite agreement embodied in the decree of the court and was, therefore, exempt from registration."
ARG,"If the matter had stood there, the learned Advocate for the appellant could not have seriously contested the position, but he vehemently argued that when the agreement was not to pay the same amount of royalty or commission as previously agreed to but an altered amount of royalty and commission, the document should be held to fall within the mischief of section 17 (1)(d)of the (1) P.C. 839 ."

COUNSEL,"P.L. Banerjee (H. J. Urnrigal, with him), for the respondents."
RLC,The trial Judge held in favour of the defendant on the last point mentioned above and negatived his other pleas.
RLC,"Against this decision, the defendant took an appeal to the High Court of Allahabad which was heard by a Division Bench consisting of Verma and York JJ."
RLC,"The learned Judges reversed the judgment of the trial Judge and dismissed the plaintiff 's suit on one ground only, viz., that the bond was not attested in the manner required by law and consequently could not rank as a mortgage bond; and as the suit was instituted beyond 6 years from the date of the bond, no money decree could be claimed by the plaintiff."
RLC,The trial Judge was to decide which of the two versions was correct and he ac cepted the story of the plaintiff and rejected that of the defendant.
RLC,"The learned Judges of the High Court in dealing with the appeal do observe, at the beginning of their discussions, that on a question of fact the appellate court should be slow to differ from the conclusions arrived at by the trial Judge who had seen and heard the witnesses; but in their opinion, this rule did not apply to the present case as the trial Judge here did not base his conclusions on the impres sions created in his mind by the witnesses who deposed before him."
RLC,"What the trial Judge relied upon, it is said, was not the demeanour of the witnesses as index of their credibility but upon the inherent improbability of the circumstances deposed to by the defendant 's witnesses."
RLC,"It is observed by the High Court that the trial Judge, when he found the defendant 's story to be improbable, should have considered whether or not there were improbable features in the plaintiff 's case also, and whether the evidence of the plaintiff and his servant Buddhu Lal merited credence at all."
RLC,The learned Judges of the High Court then proceed to examine and discuss at great length the different reasons put forward by the trial Judge in support of his finding that the defendant 's case was unreliable.
RLC,These reasons are held to be inconclusive and unsound and the High Court further found that the plaintiff 's story 788 as narrated by him and his servant is improbable and not worthy of belief.
RLC,"In our opinion, the High Court 's approach to the case has not been proper and its findings are unsupportable on the materials in the record."
RLC,Here was a case where the controversy related to a 'pure question of fact which had to be determined by weighing and appraising of conflicting oral testimony adduced by the parties.
RLC,"It cannot be denied that in estimating the value of oral testimony, the trial Judge, who sees and hears the witnesses, has an advantage which the appellate court does not possess."
RLC,The High Court was wrong in thinking that it would detract from the value to be attached to a trial Judge 's finding of fact if the Judge does not expressly base his conclusion upon the impressions he gathers from the demeanour of witnesses (1).
RLC,It is said by the High Court that in the mofussil districts in the United Provinces the Patwari is the person generally em ployed for drafting and scribing deeds.

JUDGE,The Court delivered judgment as follows.
RLC,"These appeals were heard together by two learned Judges of the Madras High Court and they took the view that the judgment debtors ' application under the Madras Act was maintainable notwith standing the fact that the sale had been confirmed and full satisfaction of the decree recorded, and remitted the case to the trial Court for a finding on the following questions, namely (1) whether the applicants were agriculturists; and (2) if so, what would be the result of applying the provisions of Madras Act IV of 1938 to the decretal debt against them ? So far as regards the judgment debtors ' appeal against the order dismissing their application under Order XXI, rule 90, the Learned Judges were inclined to agree with the trial Court that the sale should stand but declined to pass final orders in the appeal on the ground that ""it would seriously prejudice the judgment debtors in the connected application for relief under section 19 of the Madras Act IV of 1938."
RLC,""" The Subordinate Judge answered the questions referred to him by the High Court on remand as follows : (1) The judgment debtors were not agriculturists and were not therefore entitled to the benefits of the Madras Act;and (2) If they were agriculturists, they were not liable to pay anything under the decree, as, in view of the provisions of the Act, the debt stood discharged on the date of sale."
RLC,"When however the matter came up before the learned Judges of the High Court, they reversed the first finding of the trial Court and held that the judgmentdebtors were agriculturists within the meaning of the 810 Act, and that the debt stood discharged in view of section 8 (2) of the Act."
RLC,"At the same time, they held that the sale was not liable to be set aside, and in this view dismissed one of the appeals and allowed the other."
RLC,""" The trial Court dismissed the latter petition on the ground that it was not maintainable, and the judgment debtors filed an appeal against the order."
RLC,The appeal as well as the review petition of the judgment debtors were heard together by the learned Judges who directed the decree holder 's counsel to elect whether his client would deposit the purchase money into Court or have the sale set aside.
RLC,"The decree holder applied for a short adjournment and ultimately on the 15th November, 1946, his counsel stated that his client wished to retain the property which he had purchased and to pay the purchase money into Court."
RLC,"Thereupon, he was directed to pay the sum of Rs. 21,000 together with interest within a months from that date."
RLC,"Subsequently, the appellant (decree holder) having obtained leave to appeal from the High Court preferred 811 these appeals before us."
RLC,"It may be stated here that along with the application for leave to appeal, the appellant had filed an application for excusing the delay in filing the former application which he accounted for mainly by refer ring to the proceedings for the review of the judgments in the previous appeals to the High Court."
RLC,This application was granted and the delay was condoned.
RLC,"As has been already stated, the main point arising in these appeals relates to the effect of the Madras Act upon this litigation."
RLC,"That Act was passed and came into effect in 1938, while the execution proceedings were still continu ing."
STATUTE,"The sections of the Act which are material for the purpose of these appeals are sections 3, 8 and 19."
STATUTE,Section 3 defines an agriculturist and has a proviso stating that in certain cases a person shall not be deemed to be an agricul turist.
STATUTE,"The other material sections 8 and 19 run as follows : ""8."
STATUTE,"Debts incurred before the 1st October, 1932, shall be scaled down in the manner mentioned hereunder, namely: (1) All interest outstanding on the 1st October, 1937, in favour of any creditor of an agriculturist whether the same be payable under law, custom or contract or under a decree of Court and whether the debt or other obligation has ripened into a decree or not, shall be deemed to be dis charged, and only the principal or such portion thereof as may be outstanding shall be deemed to be the amount repay able by the agriculturist on that date."
STATUTE,"(2) Where an agriculturist has paid to any creditor twice the amount of the principal whether by way of princi pal or interest or both, such debt including the principal, shall be deemed to be wholly discharged."
STATUTE,"(3) Where the sums repaid by way of principal or inter est or both fall short of twice the amount of the principal, such amount only as would make up this shortage, or the principal amount or such portion of the principal amount as is outstanding, whichever is smaller, shall be repayable."
STATUTE,"(4) Subject to the provisions of sections 22 to 25, nothing contained in sub sections (1), (2) and (8) shall be deemed to require the creditor to refund any sum which has been paid to him, or to increase the liability of a debtor to pay any sum in excess of the amount which would have been payable by him if this Act had not been passed."

JUDGE,The Judgment of the Court was deliv ered by KANIA C.J.
STATUTE,The assessee company claimed this before the Income tax Appellate Tribunal as a deduction permitted under section 10 (2) (xv) of the Indian Income tax Act.
STATUTE,"The relevant part of that section runs as follows : ""10."
STATUTE,"(1) ""The tax shall be payable by an assessee under the head 'Profits and gains of business, profession or vocation ' in respect of the profits or gains of any busi ness, profession or vocation carried on by him ' (2) Such profits or gains shall be computed after making the following allowances, namely : (xv) any expenditure (not being in the nature of capital expenditure or personal expenses of the assessee) laid out or expended wholly and exclusively for the purpose of such business, profession or vocation."
STATUTE,"In the statement of the case submitted by the Tribunal after reciting the fact of the incorporation of the company and the terms of the compromise mentioned above, the argu ments urged on behalf of the assessee company have been recapitulated."
RLC,The Tribunal rejected that argument.
RLC,"On the reference, the High Court also reject ed the same and it was not presented before us."
ARG,"The next argument of the respondents was that in respect of Rs. 22,500 it was entitled to exemption under section 10(2) (xv) of the Income tax Act on the ground that the payment was an expenditure which was not in the nature of a capital expend iture or personal expenses of the applicant company but was an expenditure laid out wholly and exclusively for the purpose of its business."
RLC,That contention was rejected by the Tribunal.
RLC,This statement of the case prepared by the Incometax Tribunal and submitted to the High Court for its opinion was perused by the parties and they had no suggestions to make in respect of the same.
RLC,The statement of the case was thus settled with the knowledge and approval of the parties.
RLC,"When the matter came before the High Court, Mr. Mitra, who argued the case for the present respondents, as shown by the judgment of the High Court, urged as follows: "" If the applicant company had not agreed to pay the amount mentioned ; 1014 in the aforesaid agreement, then the Basanti Cotton Mills Ltd. would have sued the company for the realisation of the amounts due on the hundis and it seems that there would have been no defence to the action."

JUDGE,The judgment of the Court was deliv ered by FAzL ALl J.
STATUTE,"The Bihar Sales Tax Act was passed in 1944, and section 4 of the Act provides that ""every dealer whose gross turn over during the year immediately preceding the commencement of the Act exceeded Rs. 5,000 shall be liable to pay tax under the Act on sales effected after the date so notified."
STATUTE,"Section 7 of the Act provides that ""no dealer shall, while being liable under section 4 to pay tax under the Act, carry on business as a dealer unless he has been registered under the Act and possesses a registration certificate""."
STATUTE,"Section 10 (5), under which the notice purported to have been issued, runs thus: ""If upon information which has come into his posses sion, the Commissioner is satisfied that any dealer has been liable to pay tax under this Act in respect of any period and has nevertheless wilfully failed to apply for registra tion, the Commissioner shall, alter giving the dealer a reasonable opportunity of being heard, assess, to the best of his judgment, the amount of tax, if any, due from the dealer in respect of such 801 period and all subsequent periods and the Commissioner may direct that the dealer shall pay, 'by way of, penalty, in addition to the amount so assessed, a sum not exceeding one and a half times that amount."
STATUTE,""" Section 21 of the Act provides that if the Board of Revenue refuses to make a reference to the High Court, the applicant may apply to the High Court against such refusal, and the High Court, if it is not satisfied that such refusal was justified, may require the Board of Revenue to state a case and refer it to the High Court."
STATUTE,"The section also provides that ""the High Court upon the hearing of any such case shall decide the question of law raised thereby, and shall deliver its judgment thereon containing the grounds on which such decision is founded, and shall send to the Board of Revenue a copy of such judg ment under the seal of the Court . . and the Board shall dispose of the case accordingly."
STATUTE,""" In accordance with this section, the appellant made an application to the High Court praying that the Board of Revenue may be called upon to state a case and refer 802 it to the High Court."
RLC,"Dealing with this application, the High Court pointed out that the Member of the Board had not been asked to review his predecessor 's order but only to state a case, and gave the following directions : ""The ease must, therefore, go back to the Board of Revenue for a case to be stated or for a proper ,order rejecting the application to be passed."" The Board then reheard the matter and rejected the application of the appellant and refused to state a case and refer it to the High Court."
RLC,"The appellant thereafter made an application to the High Court for requiring the Board of Revenue to state a case, but this application was summarily rejected."
RLC,"He then applied to the High Court for leave to appeal to the Federal Court, which the High Court granted, following the decision of a Full Bench of the Lahore High Court in Feroze Shah Kaka Khd vs Income tax Commissioner, punjab and N.W.F.P., Lahore The High Court pointed out in the order granting leave that in the appeal that was taken to the Privy Council in the Lahore case, an objection had been raised as to the competency of the appeal, but the Privy Council, while dismissing the appeal on the merits, had made the following observation: "" The objection is a serious one."
RLC,And this present appeal was held by the Full Court to be so justified.
RLC,"Before the Board the question was not fully argued, and their Lordships accordingly refrain from expressing any opinion whatever upon it"" (2)."
RLC,The High Court in granting leave to the appellant seems to have been influenced mainly by the fact that the view of the Lahore High Court had not been held by the Privy Council to be wrong.
STATUTE,All that the High Court is required to do under section 21 of the Bihar Sales Tax Act is to decide the question of law raised and send a copy of its judgment to the Board of Revenue.

RLC,"On appeal to the High Court, the judgment of the Civil Judge was set aside and the plaintiff 's suit was decreed."
ARG,"The first point raised by Mr. Banerjee turns upon the construction to be placed upon the document executed by Babu Ram on his own behalf as well as on behalf of Nand Lal then an infant, by which the properties in dispute were trans ferred to Mst."
STATUTE,"This is the general principle of law which is recognised and embodied in section 8 of the Transfer of Property Act and unless it is shown that under Hindu Law a gift to a female means a limited gift or carries with it the restrictions or disabilities similar to those that exist in a 'widow 's estate ', there is no justification for departing from this principle."
RLC,The High Court in reaching its decision adverse to the appellant laid great stress on the fact that the grant was expressed to be for maintenance and residence of Mst.

STATUTE,By article III (6) of the covenant the then Ruler of Patiala became the first President or Raj Pramukh of the Council of Rulers and he is to hold the office during his lifetime.
STATUTE,"Article VI of the covenant is as follows : ""(1) The Ruler of each Covenanting State shall, as soon as may be practicable, and in any event not later than the 20th of August, 1948, make over the administration of his State to the Raj Pramukh, and thereupon, (a) all rights, authority and jurisdiction belonging to the Ruler which appertain, or are incidental to the Govern ment of the Covenanting State shall vest in 130 the Union and shall thereafter be exercisable only as pro vided by this Covenant or by the Constitution to be framed thereunder; (b) all duties and obligations of the Ruler pertaining or incidental to the Government of the Covenanting State shall devolve on the Union and shall be discharged by it; (c) all the assets and liabilities of the Covenanting State shall be the assets and liabilities of the Union, and (d) the military forces, if any, of the Covenanting State shall become the military forces of the Union."

STATUTE,"The proviso to clause (2) of that Article runs as follows : ""Provided that until a Constitution framed by the Con stituent Assembly comes into operation after receiving the assent of the Raj Pramukh, the Raj Pramukh shall have power to make and promulgate Ordinances for the peace and good government of the Union or any part thereof, and any Ordi nance so made shall, for the space of not more than six months from its promulgation have the like force of law as an Act passed by the Constituent Assembly;but any such Ordinance may be controlled or superseded by any such Act."
STATUTE,""" Section 6 provides for the adaptation of the laws etc."
STATUTE,"enforced under section 3 and, amongst other things, any reference in these laws etc."
STATUTE,"Section 3 (1) runs as follows: ""3."
STATUTE,"(1) As from the appointed day, all laws and rules, regulations, bye laws and notifications made thereunder, and all other provisions having the force of law, in Patiala State on the said day shall apply mutatis mutandis to the territories of the Union and all laws in force in the other Covenanting States immediately before that day shall cease to have effect; Provided that all suits, appeals, revisions applica tions, reviews, executions and other proceedings, or any of them, whether Civil or Criminal or Revenue, pending in the Courts and before authorities of any Covenanting States shall, notwithstanding anything contained in this Ordinance, be disposed of in accordance with the laws governing such proceedings in force in any such Covenanting State immedi ately before the appointed day."
STATUTE,""" By section 2 (a) the ""appointed day"" was defined as meaning the 5th day of Bhadon, 2005, corresponding to August 20, 1948."
STATUTE,There was a section providing for adaptation similar to section 6 of the Ordinance 1 of 2005.
STATUTE,"Section 5 of that Ordinance introduced several amend ments to the Patiala Income Tax Act, 2001."
STATUTE,"It recast 133 sections 3 and 34 of that Act and introduced a new section as section 23B. Section 6 of that Ordinance runs thus: ""6."
STATUTE,"Article 31(1) runs as follows: ""(1) No person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law."
STATUTE,""" It will be noticed that clause (1) reproduces subsection (1) of section 299 of the Government of India Act, 1935, without the words ""in British India."
STATUTE,""" Reference has 'next to be made to article 265 which is in Part XII, Chapter I, dealing with ""Finance."" That article provides that no tax shall be levied or collected except by authority of law."
STATUTE,"There 'was no similar provision in the corresponding chapter of the Government of India Act, 1935."
STATUTE,"If collection of taxes amounts to deprivation of property within the meaning of article 31(1), then there was no point in making a sepa rate provision again as has been made in article 265."
STATUTE,"It, therefore, follows that clause (1) of article 31 must be regarded as concerned with deprivation of property otherwise than by the imposition or collection of tax, for otherwise article 265 becomes wholly redundant."
STATUTE,"Article 265, 137 not being in Chapter IIi of the Constitution, its protection is not a fundamental right which can be enforced by an application to this court under article 32."
STATUTE,It is not our purpose to say that the right secured by article 265 may not be enforced.

RLC,In the present case the High Court has considered that there has been no infringement of this procedural law and we see no reason to come to a different conclusion.

COUNSEL,H.J. Umrigar for the respondents.
JUDGE,The Judgment of the Court was delivered by CHANDRASEKHARA AIYAR J.
RLC,The Subordinate Judge held that this plea of the judgment debtors could not be entertained in the Miscellaneous case before him relating to the execution and all that could be done was to notify the mortgage encumbrance without deciding anything as to the correctness of the amount claimed to be due under it; and this conclusion was partly based on the fact that section 16 of the Act had been declared by the High Court void.
RLC,Ap peals taken to the High Court were dismissed.
STATUTE,"The judgment debtors thereupon preferred an appeal to the Feder al Court, contending that sections 7 and 13 of the new Act (corresponding to sections 7 and 11 of the old Act)were applicable and that it was the duty of the court to estimate the value of the property after making the necessary calcu lations under section 7 with reference to the lien."
RLC,"The Subordinate Judge held that the amount of the loan should be taken as the amount mentioned in the mortgage deed of 1931 and not the amount advanced in 1893 and that a sum of Rs. 70,840 was still due on the bond."
RLC,"He determined the market value of the several properties given as security, adopting 16 times the net income as the basis."
RLC,Appeals to the High Court were numbered as M.A. 108 to 111 of 1943 and they were heard by Manohar Lall and Imam JJ.
RLC,They modified the order of the lower Court in certain re spects.
STATUTE,The correct interpretation of section 7 was not in question between the parties.
STATUTE,To say that the appellants were entitled to take advantage of the provisions of section 7 is entirely different from the contention that the inter pretation sought to be put by them on section 7 was the right one.
RLC,But the Patna High Court has been consistently placing upon the section an interpretation which is opposed to the contention of the appellant in these proceedings.
RLC,Appeals dismissed.
RLC,The High Court in reaching its decision adverse to the appellant laid great stress on the fact that the grant was expressed to be for maintenance and residence of Mst.

STATUTE,""" Section 7 (1) (c) under which the aforesaid order purports to have been made reads (so far as material here) as follows : ""The Provincial Government or any authority authorised by it in this behalf if satisfied that such action is neces sary for the purpose of preventing or combating any activity prejudicial to the public safety or the maintenance of public order may, by order in writing addressed to a print er, publisher or editor require that any matter relating to a particular subject or class of subjects shall before publication be submitted for scrutiny."""
ARG,The petitioners claim that this provision infringes the fundamental right to the freedom of speech and expression conferred upon them by article 19 (1) (a) of the Constitu tion inasmuch as it authorises the imposition of a restric tion on the publication of the journal which is not justi fied under clause (2) of that article. 
ARG,There can be little doubt that the imposition of precensorship on a journal is a restriction on the liberty of the press which is an essential part of the right to freedom of speech and expression declared by article 19 (1)(a). 
ARG,"As pointed out by Blackstone in his Commentaries ""the liberty of the press consists in laying no previous restraint upon publications, and not in freedom from censure for criminal matter when published. "
ARG,"Every freeman has an undoubted right to lay what sentiments he pleases before the public; to forbid this, is to destroy the freedom of the press(1)."
ARG,"It is contended on behalf of the petitioners that notwithstanding these recitals the order complained against is liable to be quashed, because it amounts to an infringement of the right of freedom of speech and expression guaranteed by article 19 (1) (a) of the Constitution. "
STATUTE,"Articles 19 (1) (a) and (2), which are to be read together, run as follows : 19, (1) All citizens shall have the right (a) to freedom of speech and expression; * * * * (2) Nothing in sub clause (a) of clause (1) shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it relates to, or prevent the State from making any law relating to, libel, slander, defamation, contempt of Court or any matter which offends against decency or morality or which undermines the security of, or tends to overthrow, the State. "
STATUTE,"The East Punjab Public Safety Act, 1949, of which sec tion 7 is a part, was passed by the Provincial Legislature in exercise of the power conferred upon it by section 100 of the Government of India Act, 1935, is 611 read with Entry 1 of List II of the Seventh Schedule to that Act, which includes among other matters ""public order.""  "
STATUTE,"It was not disputed that under the Government of India Act, 1935 (under, which the impugned Act was passed) it was the responsibility of each Province to deal with all internal disorders whatever their magnitude may be and to preserve public tranquillity and order within the Province. "
ARG,"The line of argument advanced on behalf of the petitioners is that since the Act has been passed in exercise of the power granted by the expression ""public order,"" used in the Government of India Act, which is a general term of wide import, and since it purports to provide for the maintenance of public order, its provisions are intended or are liable to be used for all cases of breaches of public order, be they small or insignificant breaches or those of a grave or serious nature. "
ARG,"It was argued that ""public safety"" and ""maintenance of public order"" are used in the Act disjunctively and they are separated by the word ""or"" and not ""and,"" and therefore we cannot rule out the possibility of the Act providing for ordinary as well as serious cases of disturbance of public order and tranquillity."
STATUTE,"It is needless to add that the word ""State"" has been defined in article 12 of the Constitution to include ""the Government and Parlia ment of India and the Government and Legislature of each of the States and all local or other authorities within the territory of India or under the control of the Government of India.

JUDGE,"The judgment of Kania C.J., Patanjali Sastri J. Das J. and Chandrasekhara Aiyar J. was delivered by Das J. Mahajan J. and Fazl Ali J. delivered separate judgments."
RLC,"The High Court took the view that the word ""void"" was used in article 13 (1) in the sense of ""repealed"" and that consequently it attracted section 6 of the General Clauses Act, which Act by article 367 was made applicable for the interpretation of the Constitution."
RLC,"The High Court, therefore, reached the conclusion that proceedings under the Indian Press (Emergency Powers) Act, 1931, which were pending at the date of the commence ment of the Constitution were not affected, even if the Act were inconsistent with the fundamental rights conferred by article 19 (1)(a)and as such became void under article 13 (1) of the Constitution after January 26, 1950."
RLC,The High Court accordingly answered the second question in the af firmative and dismissed the petitioner 's application.
ARG,"Learned counsel appearing in support of this appeal urged that the Indian Press (Emergency Powers) Act, 1931, was one of the many repressive laws enacted by an alien Government with a view to stifle the liberty of the Indian subjects and particularly of the Indian Press; that, with the advent of independence the people of India began to breathe freely and by the Constitution which they gave unto themselves they took care to guarantee to themselves the fundamental rights of free citizens of a democratic republic and that article 13 (1) of that Constitution brushed aside all vestiges of subordination which the tyranny of the alien rulers had imposed upon them and declared all 232 laws inconsistent with the fundamental rights to be void as if they had never been passed and had never existed."
ARG,"It was, therefore, against the spirit of the Constitution, argued the learned counsel, that a free citizen of India should still continue to be persecuted under such a retro grade law which, being inconsistent with the fundamental rights, must be declared to be void."
ARG,"Learned counsel urged that it was not necessary for him to contend that such inconsistent laws became void ab initio or that all past and closed transactions could be reopened but he contended that on and from January 26, 1950, when the Constitution came into force such inconsistent laws which became void could not be looked at for any purpose and far less could they be utilised for the purpose of framing a charge or punishing a free citizen."
ARG,"As the void law cannot be utilised any long er, the pending prosecutions, according to learned counsel, must fall to the ground."
ARG,"To permit pending proceedings under a law which, after the commencement of the Constitu tion had become void, to proceed further, after the Consti tution has taken effect, is to prolong the efficacy of the law notwithstanding that it has become void on and from the date the Constitution came into force and that is against the spirit of the Constitution."
STATUTE,Article 372 (2) gives power to the President to adapt and modify existing laws by way of repeal or amendment.
STATUTE,"There is nothing to prevent the President, in exercise of the powers conferred on him by that article, from repealing, say the whole or any part of the Indian Press (Emergency Powers) Act, 1931."
STATUTE,"If the President does so, then such repeal will at once attract section 6 of the General Clauses Act."
STATUTE,"In such a situation all prosecutions under 233 the Indian Press (Emergency Powers) Act, 1931, which were pending at the date of its repeal by the President would be saved and must be proceeded with notwithstanding the repeal of that Act unless an express provision was otherwise made in the repealing Act."
STATUTE,"Article 13 (1) with which we are concerned for the pur poses of this application is in these terms: ""All laws in force in the territory of India immediately before the commencement of this Constitution, in so far as they are inconsistent with the provisions of this Part, shall, to the extent of such inconsistency, be void."
STATUTE,""" It will be noticed that all that this clause declares is that all existing laws, in so far as they are inconsistent with the provisions of Part II1 shall, to the extent of such inconsistency, be void."
STATUTE,What article 13(1) provides is that all existing laws which clash with the exercise of the fundamental rights (which are for the first time created by the Constitution) shall to that extent be void.
RLC,"The High Court held that the provisions of article 13(1) were analogous to the repeal of a statute and therefore section 6 of the General Clauses Act had application to the construction of these provisions and that being so, the coming into force of the Constitution did (1) ; 180 E.R. 1403; 248 not in any way affect the continuance of the proceedings that had been commenced against the appellant under the law that was in force at the time of the publication of the pamphlet."

STATUTE,"Section 48 of the Code is in these terms : ""48."
STATUTE,"(1) The land revenue leviable on any land under the provisions of this Act shall be assessed, or shall be deemed to have been assessed, as the case may be, with reference to the use of the land (a) for the purpose of agriculture, (b) for the purpose of building, and (c) for a purpose other than agriculture or building."
STATUTE,"(2) Where land assessed for use for any purpose is used for any other purpose, the assessment fixed under the provi sions of this Act upon such land shall, notwithstanding that the term for which such assessment may have been fixed has not expired, be liable to be altered and fixed at a differ ent rate by such authority and subject to such rules as the Provincial Government may prescribe in this behalf . . . "" 269 After the Act came into force, the Government drafted rules under the provisions of section 214 for promulgation."
RLC,The trial Judge negatived all the technical objections raised by the defendant and on the merits held that the Collector 's action in refusing to levy nonagricultural assessment on the lands in question was wrongful.
RLC,The High Court assumed that the confirmation of the action of the Collector by the Government amounted to a direction by the Government to the contrary in respect of the lands in question.

JUDGE,The judgment of the Court was deliv ered by FAZL ALL J.
RLC,"The High Court has delivered a somewhat elaborate judg ment in the case, but it seems to us that the point ' aris ing in this appeal is a simple one."
RLC,I think the Civil Court can have no jurisdic tion to challenge the validity of such order.
RLC,""" The High Court did not however accept this view, and after referring to section 111 of the Transfer of 149 Property Act, proceeded to propound its own view in these words: ""Regard being had to the circumstances in which the Act under consideration was enacted and its object, as stated in the preamble as being 'to prevent unreasonable eviction of tenants ' from buildings, it would seem that the expres sion 'non payment of rent ' in section 11 in the context in which it is used must be given an interpretation which would have the effect of enlarging the protection against determi nation of a tenancy enjoyed by a tenant under the ordinary law."
STATUTE,"Section 11 begins with the words ""Notwithstand ing anything contained in any agreement or law to the con trary,"" and hence any attempt to import the provisions relating to the law of transfer of property for the inter pretation of the section would seem to be out of place."
STATUTE,"Section 11 is a self contained section, and it is wholly unnecessary to go outside the Act for determining whether a tenant is liable to be evicted or not, and under what condi tions he can be evicted."
STATUTE,"Sub section (8) (b) of section 11 provides that the ""Controller shall, if he is satisfied that the claim of the landlord is bona fide, make an order directing the tenant to put the landlord in possession of the building"" and if he is not so satisfied he shall make an order rejecting the application."
STATUTE,Section 16 empowers the Controller to make enquiries and inspections and to summon and enforce the attendance of witnesses and compel the production of documents in the same manner as is provided in the Code of Civil Procedure.
STATUTE,"Section 18 pro vides that any person aggrieved by an order passed by the Controller may within 15 days of the receipt of such order by him, prefer an appeal to the Commissioner of the Divi sion, and it also prescribes the procedure for the hearing of the appeal."
STATUTE,"Sub section (3) 151 of this section states that ""the decision of the Commission er and subject only to such decision, an order of the Con troller shall be final, and shall not be liable to be ques tioned in any Court of law whether in a suit or other pro ceeding by way of appeal or revision."

JUDGE,The judgment of the Court was delivered by PATANJALI SASTRI J.
ARG,"The appellant 's main defence was that on a proper con struction of section 3 of the Essential Supplies (Temporary Powers) Act, 1946, hereinafter referred to as the Act) it was not competent for the Government to pass the order of 5th December, 1947, which was consequently illegal and void, and that obstruction to the execution of that order could not constitute an offence under section 186 of the Indian Penal Code."
RLC,The contention was rejected and the appellant was convicted and sentenced to simple imprisonment for a term of three weeks.
RLC,"On appeal, the Sessions Judge, Patna, confirmed the conviction and sentence, agreeing with the findings of the trial court, and a Revision Petition preferred by the appel lant was rejected by the High Court, 307 which, however, granted a certificate under article 134 (1) (c) of the Constitution that the case was a fit one for appeal to this court as it involved a point of ""sufficient public importance"" as to the interpretation of section 3 of the Act."
STATUTE,"Section 3, so far as it is material here, runs as follows : ""3."
STATUTE,"(1) The Central Government, so far as it appears to it to be necessary or expedient for maintaining or increas ing supplies of any essential commodity, or for securing their equitable distribution and availability at fair prices, may, by notified order, provide for regulating or prohibiting the production, supply and distribution thereof, and trade and commerce therein."
STATUTE,"(2) Without prejudice to the generality of the powers conferred by sub section (1), an order made thereunder may provide (j) for any incidental and supplementary matters, in cluding in particular the entering, and search of premises, vehicles, vessels and aircraft, the seizure by a person authorised to make such search of any articles in respect of which such person has reason to believe that a contravention of the order has been, is being, or is about to be commit ted, the grant or issue of licences, permits or other docu ments, and the charging of fees therefor."
ARG,""" It was contended that an order under sub section (1) should be in the nature of a rule or regulation of general application, like the Sugar and Sugar Products Control Order, 1947, issued by the Central Government on 4th August, 1947, as the sub section confers on the Central Government only the power to ""provide for regulating or prohibiting"" the production, supply, distribution, etc., of essential commodities, and does not authorise the making of ad hoc or special orders with respect to any particular person or thing."
ARG,"On the other hand, counsel for the respondent main tained that for an offence under that section it was not necessary that the act which was obstructed must be duly authorised and otherwise lawful if it was being done or was sought to be done by a public servant honestly and in good faith believing that it was part of his public functions, and reliance was placed in support of this view on the decisions of the Madras High Court in Queen Empress vs Poomalai Udayan(3), Public Prosecutor vs Madava Bhonjo Santos(4) and Peer Masthan Rowther vs Emperor(5)."
STATUTE,"Section 2(1) of the Defence of India Act, 1939, as amended by section 2 of the Defence of India (Amendment) Act, 1940, empowered the Central Government to make rules for securing the defence of British India, the public safe ty, the maintenance of public order, etc., and sub section (2) enacted ""without prejudice to the generality of the powers conferred by sub section (1), the rules may provide for all or any of the following matters .

ARG,"On behalf of the deity, the entire amount of compen sation money was claimed by Deosaran Singh and Ram Lakshman Singh, who alleged themselves to be shebaits, on the basis that the premises in question were debutter properties of the deity, and the Bagarias had acquired no interest therein either by the assignment of the usufructuary mortgage or the alleged purchase of the tenant 's rights in the properties."

JUDGE,1951 March 5. The judgment of the Court was delivered by MUKHERJEA J.
RLC,"The High Court forwarded 295 these applications to the lower court for enquiry into the matter and for return, with its finding on the question as to whether the applicants were agriculturists, and if so, to what extent, the decretal dues should be scaled down."
RLC,"The District Judge, ' after making enquiries, submitted a finding that the applicants were agriculturists and that the debt, if scaled down, would amount to Rs. 49,255 with interest thereupon at 6% per annum from 1st of October, 1937, exclu sive of costs."
RLC,"On receipt of this finding, the appeals were set down for final hearing and by their judgment dated March 23, 1942, the learned Judges of the High Court accepted the finding of the court below and held that defendants 2 to 7 were entitled to have the debts scaled down; but as no application had been made on behalf of defendant No. 1, he was held entitled to no relief under the Act."
RLC,A decree was drawn up in accordance with the judgment.
RLC,"The amount due by defendants 2 to 7 was stated to be Rs. 49,255 with inter est thereon at 6% per annum; while, so far as defendant No. 1 was concerned, the decree of the trial judge was affirmed subject to a slight modification regarding the rate of interest."
RLC,"The defendant No. 1 thereupon filed an applica tion in the court of the District Judge, East Tanjore, claiming relief under the Agriculturists ' Relief Act alleg ing that he too was an agriculturist and hence entitled to the benefits of the Act."
RLC,"The application was dismissed on February 25, 1943, on the ground that as the decree had already been passed by the High Court definitely negativing his claim to any relief under the Agriculturists ' Relief Act, such application was not entertainable by the lower court."
RLC,"The next step taken by the defendant No. 1 was to file an application in the High Court itself, praying for setting aside the ex parte decree which excluded him from the benefits of Act IV of 1938."
RLC,"This application was re jected by the High Court on December 13, 1943."
RLC,"As no payment was made in accordance with the prelimi nary decree passed by the High Court, a final decree in terms of the same was passed by the 296 District Judge on September 25, 1943. ' Proceedings for execution of this final decree were started on August 16, 1944, in E.P. 2 of 1945 of the court of the District Judge, East Tanjore."
RLC,"This contention was negatived by the District Judge, but was accepted by the High Court on appeal, who allowed the application of defendant No. 1 and directed that the court below should enter up full satisfac tion of the mortgage decree."

JUDGE,The judgment of the Court was deliv ered by MAHAJAN J.
ARG,"Plaintiffs contested the suit alleging that Bisheshwar 's mokarrari interest had merged in the lakhraj interest that was purchased by him from the Pathaks in the years 1916 17, and that by the sale under the Government 's certificate his whole eight anna interest in the village including both the lakhraj and the mokarrari had passed on to the plaintiffs and that the defendants ' first party could only claim rent from them to the extent of the six anna share in the mokarrari."
RLC,This plea was disallowed and the defendants ' first party 's claim for rent was decreed in full.
RLC,The decree was upheld on appeal and second appeal.
RLC,"The question of title was, however, left open."
ARG,"In the plaint, it was alleged that there was a private partition between the mokarraridars by virtue of which the lands of village Darha were divided between the three sets of mokarraridars, each set being 157 in separate possession of its own separate and defined shares."
ARG,"It was also pleaded that there was another parti tion between the proprietors of the lakhrai interest, that is, between Bisheshwar Dayal Singh on the one hand and Deolal Pathak, Neman Pathak and Surajnath Pathak on the other, by virtue of which the lands that were in mokarrari patties of Parmeshwar Dayal Singh and others and Hiranand Jha and Durganand Jha fell in the patti of Deolal Pathak and others, while, the lands that were in the mokarrari patti of the defendants ' second party fell in his proprietary lakhraj patti and that as a result of these partitions the mokarrari interest of the defendants ' second party merged in his lakhraj interest and under a certificate sale the whole of his interest passed to the plaintiffs."
RLC,The trial Judge held that both the partitions alleged by the plaintiffs in paragraphs 5 and 8 of their plaint were proved and that the mokarrari interest of Bisheshwar Dayal Singh merged in his lakhraj interest and that at the certif icate sale the purchaser acquired his complete interest both lakhraj and mokarrari along with the eight anna lakhraj interest of the Pathaks and that the defendants ' first party were mokarraridars of six anna interest in the village and to that extent were entitled to a decree in their rent suit and could not claim a decree for rent to the extent of fourteen anna share.
RLC,The High Court in appeal held that none of the partitions alleged by the plaintiffs were proved and that the mokarrari interest of eight annas could not merge in the lakhrai interest of sixteen annas held jointly by Bisheshwar Dayal Singh with the Pathaks.

COUNSEL,"C.K. Daphtary (Sri Narain Andley, with him) for the respondents."
COUNSEL,February 23.
JUDGE,The judgment of the Court was deliv ered by MAHAJAN J.
RLC,The High Court affirmed the finding of the trial court on the first point and held in agreement with it that the respondents had not proved that they gave three months previous notice in writing to the appellants for renewal of the lease as required by clause 4 (2) of the lease.
RLC,It reversed the finding of the trial Judge on the point that the respondents had committed breaches of the terms contained in clause 2 (20) of the lease.
ARG,"It was contended before the High Court that the appeal being in the nature of a rehearing, it should be 223 decided in accordance with the provisions of Act LVII of 1947 which came into force on the 13th February, 1948, and not in accordance with the provisions of the Act in force at the time when the decree was passed by the trial court."
ARG,"In other words, the contention was that there having been a change in the law after the date of the decree passed by the trial Judge and before the appeal was heard, the rights of the parties should be determined in accordance with the law as it stood on the date of the hearing of the appeal."
RLC,The High Court gave effect to this contention and set aside the decree made for ejectment of the respondents.
ARG,"Learned counsel for the appellants challenged the deci sion of the High Court before us on three grounds: (1) that assuming that the appeal had to be decided by the High Court in accordance with the provisions of Act LVII of 1947, the provisions of that Act had no application to pending ap peals which had been excluded from its ambit; (9,)that Act LVII of 1947 had been amended by Bombay Act III of 1949 and that the appeal pending in this court should be decided in accordance with the provisions of the amended Act which excluded pending appeals from the purview of Act LVII of 1947; and (3) that the High Court wrongly reversed the trial court 's finding that the respondents had committed breaches of the terms contained in clause 2 (20) of the lease."
ARG,The learned counsel for the respondents besides controverting the contentions raised on behalf of the appellants contended that both the courts had erred in holding that the respondents had not proved that they exer cised the option of renewal of the lease according to the stipulations contained therein.
STATUTE,"Section 12 of the Act is in these terms: "" (1) A landlord shall not be entitled to the recovery of possession of any premises so long as the tenant pays, or is ready and willing to pay, the amount of the standard rent and permitted increases, if any, and observes and performs the other conditions of the tenancy, in so far as they are consistent with the provisions of this Act."
STATUTE,"(2) No suit for recovery of possession shall be insti tuted by a landlord against a tenant on the ground of non payment of the standard rent or permitted increases due, until the expiration of one month next after notice in writing of the demand of the standard rent or permitted increases has been served upon the tenant in the manner provided in section 106 of the ."
STATUTE,"(3) No decree for eviction shall be passed in any such suit if, at the hearing."

JUDGE,The following judgments were delivered: KANIA C.J. 
ARG,"The petitioner disputes the validity of the first order on the ground that the East Punjab Public Safety Act, 1949, under which the order was made, is an infringement of his fundamental right given under article 19 (1) (d) of the Constitution of India. "
ARG,"He further contends that the grounds of the order served on him are vague, insufficient and incomplete. "
ARG,"According to him the object of the externment order passed by the District Magistrate, Delhi, was to suppress political opposition to the policy of the Government in respect of Pakistan and the Muslim League. "
ARG,It is alleged that because the petitioner and the Hindu Mahasabha are against the Government policy of appeasement this order is served on him. 
ARG,It is therefore mala fide and illegal. 
STATUTE,It is necessary first to ascertain the true meaning of article 19 (1) (d) read with clause (5) of the same article.
STATUTE,""" It is clear that the clause permits imposition of reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right conferred by sub clause (d)in the interests of the general public."
ARG,"It was argued on behalf of the petitioner that under section 4 the power to make the order of externment was given to the Provincial Government or the District Magistrate, whose satisfaction was final. "
ARG,On that ground it was contended that there was an unreasonable restriction on the exercise of the citizen 's right. 
RLC,So far as the Bombay High Court is concerned Chagla C.J. appears to have decided this point against the contention of the petitioner. 
RLC,"It was next urged that under section 4 (3) the order made by the District Magistrate shall not, unless the Provincial Government by special order otherwise direct, remain in force for more than three months. "
ARG,It was argued that the period of three months itself was unreasonable as the externee had no remedy during that time. 
ARG,It was contended that when the Provincial Government directed the renewal of the order no limit of time was prescribed by the legislature for the duration of the order.
ARG,The order therefore can be in operation for an indefinite period. 
ARG,This was argued to be an unreasonable restriction on the exercise of a citizen 's right. 
STATUTE,This is a great safeguard provided under the East Punjab Public Safety Act. 
STATUTE,"The grounds are stated as follows : ""Your activities generally and particularly since the recent trouble in East and West Bengal have been of a communal nature tending to excite hatred between communities and whereas in the present composition of the population of Delhi and the recent communal disturbances of Delhi feelings are roused between the majority and minority communities, your presence and activities in Delhi are likely to prove prejudicial to the maintenance of law and order, it is considered necessary to order you to leave Delhi."" These grounds cannot be described as vague, insufficient or incomplete. "
JUDGE,FAZL ALI J. -
JUDGE,PATANJALI SASTRI J. -
RLC,"The order is for three months at present. -RLC,FACTS"
ARG,The argument is that any order passed under such void legislative provisions must necessarily be void and of no effect in law. 
STATUTE,"The East Punjab Public Safety Act came into force on 29th March, 1949, and its object, as stated in the preamble, is to provide for special measures to ensure public safety and maintenance of public order. "
STATUTE,""" This right indeed is not absolute and the extent to which it could be curtailed by legislation is laid down in clause.(5)of article 19 which runs as follows: ""Nothing in sub clauses (d), (e) and (f) of the said clause shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it imposes, or prevent the State from making any law imposing, reasonable restrictions on the exercise of any of the rights conferred by the said sub clauses either in the interests of the general public or for the protection of the interests of any Scheduled Tribe."" Thus the primary question which requires consideration is, whether the impugned legislation which apparently seems to be in conflict with the fundamental right enunciated in article 19 (1) (d) of the Constitution is protected by clause (5) of the article, under which a law would be valid if it imposes reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right in the interests of the general public. "
STATUTE,What article 19 (1) (d) of the Constitution guarantees is the free right of all citizens to go wherever they like in the Indian territory without any kind of restriction whatsoever. 
STATUTE,They can move not merely from one State to another but from one place to another within the same State and what the Constitution lays stress upon is that the entire Indian territory is one unit so far as the citizens are concerned.
STATUTE,"Clause (c) of section 4 (1) of the East Punjab Public Safety Act, 1949, authorizes the Provincial Government or the District Magistrate to direct any person to remove himself from any area and prohibit him from entering the same. "
STATUTE,"With regard to clause (5), the learned AttorneyGeneral points out at the outset that the word ""reasonable"" occurring in the clause qualifies ""restrictions"" and not ""law '"". "
ARG,"It is argued that in applying the clause, all that we have to see is whether the restrictions that are imposed upon the exercise of the right by law are reasonable or not and we have not to inquire into the reasonableness or otherwise of the law itself. "
ARG,"The reasonableness of the restrictions can be judged, ' according to the learned Attorney General, from the nature of the restrictions themselves and not from the manner in which or the authorities by which they are 532 imposed. "
STATUTE,The object of the East Punjab Public Safety Act is to provide for special measures to ensure public safety and maintenance of public order. 
STATUTE,"Under section 4 (1) (c) of the Act, the Provincial Government or the District Magistrate may make an order directing the removal of a certain person from a particular area, if they are satisfied that such order is necessary to prevent such person from acting in any way prejudicial to public safety or maintenance of public order. "
STATUTE,"In my opinion, therefore, the provision of section 4 (1) (c) of the East Punjab Public Safety Act cannot be pronounced to be unreasonable, simply because the order could be passed by the Provincial Government 534 or the District Magistrate on their own personal satisfaction and not on materials which satisfy certain objective tests. -"

STATUTE,"Rule 81(2) of the Defence of India Rules empowers the Central or the Provincial Govern ment to provide by order, in certain circumstances, for regulating amongst other matters, distribution, disposal, use or consumption of articles or things and for requiring articles or things kept for sale to be sold either generally or to specified persons or classes of persons or in speci fied circumstances."
STATUTE,""" Clause 2(d) of the Order defines ""dealer"" as meaning a supplier carrying on the business of supplying motor spirit as a retail business and includes a person having charge of a supply of motor spirit controlled by Government from which any person is furnished with motor spirit for private use."
STATUTE,"Sub clause (m) defines ""supplier"" as meaning a person carry ing on the business of supplying motor 326 spirit."
STATUTE,"Clause 5, which is the next relevant provision, runs thus : ""Motor spirit required for any vehicle not covered by clause 3 or clause 4 shall be furnished or acquired only against the surrender to a supplier at the time of supply of valid ordinary coupons or of a valid supplementary coupon and only in accordance with any conditions or instructions appearing on or attached to the coupons."
STATUTE,""" Clause 22 lays down: ""No person shall furnish or acquire a supply of motor spirit otherwise than in accordance with the provisions contained in this order."
STATUTE,"""Clause 27 is to the following effect:"" No person shall surrender to a supplier and no supplier shall accept special receipts or coupons at a time other than the time at which the supply of motor spirit authorised by the special receipts or coupons or acknowl edged by the receipts is furnished."" Clause 27A runs as follows : ""When motor spirit is furnished against the surrender of one or more coupons, the supplier shall immediately endorse, or cause to be endorsed, on each coupon so surren dered the registration or other identifying mark of the vehicle to which the motor spirit is furnished."
STATUTE,""" Rule 81(4)of the Defence of India Rules, which provides for the imposition of a penalty, says that ""if any person contravenes any order made under this rule, he shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years or with fine or both."

JUDGE,The judgment of the Court was deliv ered by KANIA C.J.
ARG,"On behalf of the appellant it is argued that when the warrant for his arrest was issued by the Magistrate on the 22nd of October, 1947, the Magistrate took cognizance of the offence and, as no sanction of the Government had been obtained before that day, the initiation of the proceedings against him, which began on that day without the sanction of the Government, was illegal."
ARG,"It is argued that the same proceedings are continuing against him and therefore the notice to 315 appear before the Magistrate issued on 25th March, 1949, is also illegal."
STATUTE,The relevant part of section 190 of the Criminal Procedure Code runs as follows: 190.
STATUTE,"(1)""Except as hereinafter provided, any Presidency Magistrate, District Magistrate or Sub divisional Magistrate and any other Magistrate specially empowered in this behalf, may take cognizance of any offence (a) upon receiving a complaint of facts which constitute such offence; (b) upon a report in writing of such facts made by any police officer; (c) upon information received from any person other than a police officer, or upon his own knowledge or suspicion, that such offence has been committed. "" It is clear from the wording of the section that the initiation of the proceedings against a person commences on the cognizance of the offence by the Magistrate under one of the three contingencies mentioned in the section."
STATUTE,"Under section 167(b) of the Criminal Procedure Code the police have of course to put up the person so arrested before a Magistrate within 24 hours and obtain an order of remand to police custody for the purpose of further investigation, if they so desire."
STATUTE,The posi tion however is materially altered because of section 3 of the Act which runs as follows: 3.
STATUTE,"""An offence punishable under section 161 or section 165 of the Indian Penal Code shall be deemed to be a cogniz able offence for the purposes of the Code of Criminal Proce dure, 1898, notwithstanding anything to the contrary con tained therein."
STATUTE,The proviso to sec tion 3 of the Act puts only two limitations on the powers of the police in connection with the investigation relating to those offences under the Act.
STATUTE,They are: (1) that the inves tigation 317 should be conducted by an officer not below the rank of a Deputy Superintendent of Police unless a Magistrate of the first class otherwise orders; and (2) if an arrest has to be made an order of the Magistrate has to be obtained.
STATUTE,"The argument of the appellant is that when the Magis trate issued the warrant in October, 1947, he did so on taking cognizance of the offence under section 161 or 165 of the Indian Penal Code under section 190 of the Criminal Procedure Code."
STATUTE,In our opinion having regard to the wording of section 3 of the Act the assumption that the Magistrate can issue a warrant only after taking cogni zance of an offence under section 190 of the Criminal Procedure Code is unsound.
STATUTE,The proviso to section 3 of the Act expressly covers the case of a Magistrate issuing a warrant for the arrest of a person in the course of investi gation only and on the footing that it is a cognizable offence.
STATUTE,Section 3 of the Act which makes an offence under section 161 or 165 of the Indian Penal Code cognizable has provided the two safeguards as the proceedings are contem plated against a public servant.
STATUTE,"But because of these safe guards it 318 does not follow that the warrant issued by the Magistrate under section 3 of the Act is after cognizance of the of fence, and not during the course of investigation by the police in respect of a cognizable offence."
STATUTE,"The material part of section 197 of the Criminal Procedure Code provides that where any public servant who is not removable from his office save with the sanction of Government is accused of an offence alleged to have been committed by him while acting or purporting to act in the discharge of his official duty, no court shall take cogni zance of such offence except with the previous sanction of the appropriate Government."
STATUTE,This section read as following section 190 shows that the word 'cognizance ' in this section indicates the stage of initiation of proceedings against a public servant.
STATUTE,"Sections 190 to 199 B of the Criminal Proce dure Code are grouped together under the caption ""Initiation of proceedings""."
STATUTE,The sections dealing with the stage of in vestigation by the police in the case of cognizable offences are quite different.
STATUTE,Under section 6 of the Act it is pro vided that no court shall take cognizance of an offence punishable under section 161 or 165 of the Indian Penal Code . alleged to have been committed by a public servant except with the previous sanction of the appropriate Government.
STATUTE,"Reading sections 197 and 190 of the Criminal Procedure Code and section 6 of the Act in the light of the wording of the proviso to section a, it is therefore clear that the stage at which a warrant is asked for under the proviso to section 3 of the Act is not on cognizance of the offence by the Magistrate as contemplated by the other three sections."

JUDGE,1951 May 24. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by PATANJALI SASTRI J.
RLC,The committing Magistrate found that a prima facie case was made out and committed the appellants to the Court of Sessions for trial.
ARG,"The appellants pleaded not guilty alleging inter alia, that Mohender and Debender, the brothers of Logendra (appel lants 2 and 3) were not present in the village of Dandkhora with which they had no concern, as all the lands in that village had been allotted to Logendra at a previous parti tion, that Logendra himself was not in the village at the time of the occurrence but arrived 678 soon after and was dragged to the place at the instance of his enemies in the village and was placed under arrest by the Assistant Sub Inspector of Police who had arrived there previously."
RLC,The learned Sessions Judge examined the evidence in great detail and found that the existence of factions as alleged by the appellants was true.
RLC,""" The learned Judge accordingly acquitted the appellants of all the charges framed against them."
RLC,"The Sessions Judge had completely misdirected himself in looking to the minor discrepancies in the case and ignoring the essential matters so far as the case is concerned,"" and there was no justifiable ground for rejecting the prosecution evidence regarding the cultivation and harvesting by Polai."
RLC,"And he concluded with the warning ""I would, however, make it per fectly clear that when the case is re tried, which I am now going to order, the Judge proceeding with the trial will not be in the least influenced by any expression of opinion which I may have given in this judgment."
ARG,""" On behalf of the appellants Mr. Sinha raised two conten tions."
ARG,"In the first place, he submitted that having regard to section 417 of the Criminal Procedure Code which provides for an appeal to the High Court from an order of acquittal only at the instance of the Government, a revision petition under section 439 at the instance of a private party was incompetent, and, secondly, that sub section (4) of section 439 clearly showed that the High Court exceeded its powers of revision in the present case in upsetting the findings of fact of the trial Judge. ' We think it is unnecessary to express any opinion on the first contention of Mr. Sinha especially as the respondent is unrepresented, as we are of opinion that his second and alternative contention must prevail."

STATUTE,"Section 7(1) of the Act as amended requires that ""Save as otherwise provided by this Act, every shop . shall remain closed on a close day."
STATUTE,""" Sub section (2)(i) states that The choice of a close day shall rest with the owner or occupier of a shop . and shall be intimated to the prescribed authority within etc."
RLC,The trying Magistrate held that in selling the article of haberdashery on a close day and in not observing Monday as a close day the appellant had infringed the provisions of section 7(1) of the Act.
RLC,He accordingly convicted him and imposed a fine of Rs. 20.
RLC,"The High Court held that as the appellant had failed to keep his shop closed one day in the week, his conviction was proper."
ARG,"The learned counsel for the appellant contended that section 7 of the Act is ultra vires in that it does not fall under any of the items in either the Provincial or the Concurrent Legislative Lists in the Government of India Act, 1935."
STATUTE,"Reliance for this was placed on section 2 A (i) and (j) which is as follows: ""2 A. Nothing in this Act shall apply to (i) persons employed in a managerial capacity . and (j) the members of the family of the employer."
STATUTE,"Section 2 A (j) does not give the son a right to keep the shop open or, for that matter, a right to sell."
STATUTE,"Section 7(1), on the other hand, is directed against the owner of the shop, not against his family."
STATUTE,Section 2 A(i) does not control section 7 (1).

RLC,"The Tribunal, however, on being asked referred the following question of law to the High Court for its opinion: ""Whether in the circumstances of the case, the asses see 's income of Rs. 20,005 is profits from business 3 within the meaning of section 2 (5) of the Excess Profits Tax Act and therefore or otherwise liable to pay excess profits tax ?"" The High Court answered the question in the negative."
RLC,"""Now, on the facts found by the Tribunal, it is clear that when the assessee let out this dyeing plant, it had remained idle for some time."
ARG,""" The learned Attorney General pointed out that the nature of a commercial asset is not changed because a par ticular person is unable to use it."
ARG,The inability of the assessee to make use of it in certain circumstances does not in any way ' affect the nature of the asset and cause an infirmity in the asset itself.
ARG,"It was contended that when the dyeing plant became idle for a short time during the chargeable accounting period it did not cease to be a com mercial asset of the respondent for it had no other busi ness; that all the assets of the respondent including the dyeing plant were the assets of the business, that whatever income was derived by the use of these assets including the income that an asset fetched by its being let out was the business income of the assessee, and that there was no warrant 5 in law for the proposition that a commercial asset which yields income must be used as an asset by the respondent himself before its income becomes chargeable to tax."
ARG,The learned counsel for the respondent urged that as soon as the assessee found difficulty in obtaining yarn the dyeing plant became redundant for its business and ceased to be an asset of its business and any income derived from the rent by letting out this asset was income received by the assessee from other sources and therefore was not charge able to excess profits tax.

ARG,The learned counsel for the appellant based his argu ments on the thesis that the ghatwali estates in question were of the same nature and character as joint family im partible estates governed by the Mitakshara law and that the rule of survive applicable to such estates was also applicable to them.
ARG,It was contended that the High Court was in error in holding that the suit properties exclusively belonged to Kali Prasad Singh or that there was anything peculiar in these tenures which differentiated them from other ghatwalis in the Santhai Pargangs or from other im partible estates known to Hindu law and which peculiarity incapacitated them from being included within the definition of coparcenary property.
ARG,The plea that females were by custom excluded from inheriting ghatwali tenures in Birbhum was 157 dropped in the two courts below and was ' not raised before us; so also the point of custom set out in para.
ARG,7 of the plaint and covered by issue 1 was not seriously urged.
ARG,"The learned Attorney General, while conceding that succession to these tenures was governed by the Mitakshara law, contended that in no sense could they be regarded as joint family property and that their peculiar characteris tics precluded the acquisition of any right by birth by members of a joint Hindu family in them."
ARG,"He also urged in the alternative that the widow was 'entitled to succeed to them, assuming them to be joint family property under cus tom."

JUDGE,The Judgment of the Court was deliv ered by MUKHERJEA J.
RLC,The trial court on a consideration of the evidence came to the conclusion that the Chikurde estate was an impartible property governed by the rules of primogeniture.
RLC,"It was held that, it being an impartible joint estate, the rule of survivorship still applied and consequently on the death of Ganpatrao, without leaving any son, the estate passed by survivorship to the next senior branch which was that of Firangojirao."
RLC,The view taken by the Subordinate Judge is that after Firangojirao 's death Bhimabai took only a provi sional interest in the property which was liable to be divested by the emergence of a male member by adoption in the family and in fact she was legally divested of her interest in the property when defendant No. 4 was adopted by Anandrao 's widow.
RLC,"In the opinion of the Subordinate Judge the resolution of the Government treating the Chikurde estate as lapsed was premature and could not be made legally so long as there were widows living, who were capable of adopting sonS."
RLC,"The trial judge held further that even 213 if Bhimabai was taken to have held the property as watan till her death, the next heir to succeed under the Bombay Act V of 1886 would be defendant No. 4 and not the plain tiffs."
RLC,The result was that the plaintiffs ' suit was dismissed.
RLC,"The learned Judges dismissed the appeal and confirmed the deci sion of the trial court, though the reasons given by them are not the same as those given by the trial judge."
RLC,"It was held by the High Court, on a construction of the Sanad granted to Vithalrao in 1892, that the order of lapse or forfeiture of the watan estate passed by the Government in the year 1923 on the ground of failure of male heirs was not a valid and legal order and although under the relevant clause of the Sanad the Government could, in the absence of male heirs, resume the watan in the sense that they could make the property liable to full assessment, the other incidents of the watan estate still continued."

JUDGE,The Judgment of the Court was deliv ered by FAZL ALl J.
ARG,""" It was argued before us that even though only 3 charges have been framed against the appellant, he has in fact been tried for 4 offences and not 3."
ARG,"The 4 offences are said to be these : (1) Committing the murder of Gurmail Singh; (2) Attempting to murder Kartar Singh, son of Sarwan Singh; (3) Attempting to murder Jangit Singh; and (4) Attempting to murder Kartar Singh, son of Bishan Singh."
ARG,"The learned counsel contended that the fact that the appellant has been acquitted of the last 3 offences and convicted only of the first offence was immaterial to the point raised by him, and we have only to see whether all the offences mentioned above could be properly tried together."
ARG,"In our opinion, the short reply to this contention is that the second charge which relates to the appellant firing at Kartar Singh and Jangir Singh is not a charge with respect to 2 offences but is a charge with respect to one offence only."
ARG,The evidence adduced by the prosecution shows that the appellant fired only one bullet.

RLC,"Shortly stated, the conclusion arrived at by the High Court was that Ratan Singh had as much right to the possession of the field as Bhagwati Kuer, that both parties were trying to take exclusive possession of the field, that both parties were prepared for all contingencies to vindicate and enforce their rights, and hence the question of possession was wholly immaterial and no right of private defence could be successfully pleaded by the appellants."

STATUTE,"Sections 3 and 4 of the Act are in these terms; "" 3."
STATUTE,The Deputy Commissioner may by notification fix a period to be an agricultural season with respect to such villages as may be specified therein.
STATUTE,"(1) The Deputy Commissioner may, by general order which shall extend to such villages as he may specify, prohibit the manufacture of bidis during the agricultural season."
STATUTE,"(2) No person residing in a village specified in such order shall during the agricultural season engage himself in the manufacture of bidis, and no manufacturer shall during the said season employ any person for the manufacture of bidis."
STATUTE,"Article 19 (1) (g) runs as follows : ""All citizens shall have the right to practise any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or busi ness."
STATUTE,""" 762 The article guarantees freedom of occupation and busi ness."
STATUTE,"The freedom guaranteed herein is, however, subject to the limitations imposed by clause (6) of article 19."
STATUTE,"That clause is in these terms : ""Nothing in sub clause (g) of the said clause shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it imposes, or prevent the State from making any law imposing, in the interests of the general public, reasonable restric tions on the exercise of the right conferred by the said sub clause, and, in particular, nothing in the said sub clause shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it prescribes or empowers any authority to prescribe, or prevent the State from making any law prescribing or empowering any authority to prescribe, the professional or technical qualifications necessary for practising any pro fession or carrying on any occupation, trade or business."
STATUTE,""" The point for consideration in these applications is whether the Central Provinces and Berar Act LXIV of 1948 comes within the ambit of this saving clause or is in excess of its provisions."
ARG,The learned counsel for the petitioners contends that the impugned Act does not impose reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the fundamental right in the interests of the general public but totally negatives it.
STATUTE,"In the preamble to the Act, it is stated that it has been enacted to provide measures for the supply of adequate labour for agricultural purposes in bidi manufacturing areas."
STATUTE,Sections 3 and 4 cited above empower the Deputy Commissioner to prohibit the manufacture of bidis during the agricultural season.
STATUTE,"The contravention of any of these provisions is made punishable by section 7 of the Act, the penalty being imprisonment for a term which may extend to six months or with fine or with both."

JUDGE,Fazl Ali J. delivered Judgment as follows.
JUDGE,"Patanjali Sastri C.J., Mahajan, Mukherjea, Das and Chandrasekhara Aiyar JJ."
ARG,""" The appellant 's case is that questioning something which has happened before a candidate is declared elected is not the same thing as questioning an election, and the arguments advanced on his behalf in support of this construction were these: (1) That the word ""election"" as used in article 329 (b) means what it normally and etymologically means, namely, the result of polling or the final selection of a candidate; (2) That the fact that an election petition can be filed only after polling is over or after a candidate is declared elected, and what is normally called in question by such petition is the final result, bears out the conten tion that the word ""election ""can have no other meaning in article (b) than the result of polling or the final selec tion of a candidate; 226 (3) That the words ""arising out of or in connection with"" which are used in article 324 (1) and the words ""with respect to all matters relating to, or in connection with"" which are used in articles 327 and s28, show that the fram ers of the Constitution knew that it was necessary to use different language when referring respectively to matters which happen prior to and after the result of polling, and if they had intended to include the rejection of a nomina tion paper within the ambit of the prohibition contained in article S29 (b) they would have used similar language in that article and (4) That the action of the Returning Officer in reject ing a nomination paper can be questioned before the High Court under article 226 of the Constitution for the follow ing reason: Scrutiny of nomination papers and their rejec tion are provided for in section 36 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951."
ARG,"Parliament has made this provision in exercise of the powers conferred on it by article 327 of the Constitution which is ""subject to the provisions of the Constitution""."
ARG,"Therefore, the action of the Returning Offi cer is subject to the extraordinary jurisdiction of the High Court under article 226."
ARG,"These arguments appear at first sight to be quite im pressive, but in my opinion there are weightier and basical ly more important arguments in support of the view taken by the High Court."
ARG,"It was argued that since the Representation of the People Act was enacted subject to the provisions of the Constitution, it cannot bar the jurisdiction of the High Court to issue writs under article 226 of the Constitution."
ARG,This argument however is completely shut out by reading the Act along with article 329 (b).

JUDGE,The Judgment of the Court was delivered by MAHAJAN J.
RLC,The learned Special Magistrate convicted both the appellants on all the three charges.
RLC,"He sentenced R.S. Patel to rigorous imprisonment for one year under each charge and to pay fines of Rs. 2,000, Rs. 2,000, and Rs. 1,000, under the first, second and third charges respectively."
RLC,"The appellant Nargundkar was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for six months under each charge and to pay fines of Rs. 2,000, Rs. 2,000 and Rs. 1.,000, under the first, second and third charges respectively."
RLC,"The learned Sessions Judge quashed the conviction of both the appellants under the first charge of criminal conspiracy under section 120 B, I.P.C., but maintained the 1093 convictions and sentences under section 465, I.P.C. or the charges of forging Exhibits P 3 (A) and P 24."
RLC,The learned Sessions Judge disagreed with this finding and the High Court agreed with the Sessions Judge on this point.
ARG,"Learned Advocate General contended that it was impossible for Patel unless he had seen Exhibit P 6, to quote rates of a large number of items numbering about 197, in every case lower than the rates given in Exhibit P 6 and the circumstance that in not a single case he has quoted a higher rate than Exhibit P 6 is conclusive of the fact that he had done so after he had seen Exhibit P 6."
ARG,It was also said that there is no satisfactory explana tion why Patel abandoned the scheme adopted by him in 1102 drawing up Exhibits P 4 and P 5 and his original tender.
ARG,"It was contended by the learned Advocate General, and this is the finding of the courts below, that this letter was written some time during the investigation of the case in July or August 1947, and was antedated in order to implicate Amarnath and to use it as evidence in defence."
ARG,It was contended by the learned Advocate General that his statement was inconsistent with the recitals contained in Exhibit P 24.

JUDGE,May 4. 'the following judgments were delivered : DAS J.
RLC,"On May 8, 1941, the Subordinate Judge settled the issues and fixed June 9, 1941, ""for a preliminary hear ing of the suit and particularly of such of the issues as have been based on the pleas in bar."" Eventually, the case was taken up for preliminary hearing on September 4, 1941, and by his judgment delivered on September 8, 1941, the learned Subordinate Judge dismissed the suit on issue No. 2 which was as follows: ""Does the plaint disclose a valid cause of action for the suit ?"" The appellants preferred an appeal to the High Court at Calcutta."
RLC,"Although the High Court (R.C. Mitter and K.C. Chunder JJ.) did not accept all the reasonings on which the learned Subordinate Judge had based his decision, they, however, agreed that the appellants could get no relief as the decrees in suit No. 78 of 1922 could not be reopened, as they were not passed in 579 ""a suit to which this Act applies"" and consequently dis missed the appeal."
ARG,The appellants have now come up on appeal before us after having obtained a certificate from the High Court under section 110 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
ARG,Learned Advocate appearing in support of this appeal before us has contended that the High Court was in error in holding that the decrees in Suit No. 78 of 1922 were not liable to be reopened under the second proviso to section 36 (1).
ARG,"Learned advocate for the respondent while joining issue on this point also raised a point which, however, did not find favour with the High Court, namely, that the respondent as a bona fide assignee for value of the mortgage debt was protected by sub section (5) of section 36."

RLC,On appeal the learned Chief Justice of the High Court and Chatterjee J. disagreed and held that it was not.
ARG,The learned counsel for the plaintiff respondent con tended that section 43 of the Contract Act applied.
ARG,"He relied on the following provision : ""Each of two or more joint promisors may compel every other joint promisor to contribute equally with himself to the performance of the promise, unless a contrary intention appears from the contract."
ARG,"If any one of two or more joint promisors makes default in such contribution, the remaining joint promisors must bear the loss arising from such default in equal shares."
ARG,""" The argument is that unless a contrary intention appears from ""the contract"" the."
ARG,loss must be borne equally.
ARG,"It was contended, and with that I agree, that the words ""the con tract"" can only refer to the main contract between the promisors on the one side and the promisee on the other."
ARG,That contract in this case is the suit mortgage.
ARG,The learned counsel for the plaintiff respondent urged that the defendants are shut out from relying on section 82 because that was not their case and the question was never raised by them in the High Court.

JUDGE,The Judgment of the Court was delivered by CHANDRASEKHARA AIYAR J.
RLC,"The High Court took the view that throughout all the stages prior to the High Court 's decree, the parties, the transport authorities vested with the power to issue per mits, and the Government also proceeded upon the footing that the transfer of the permits was dependent on the title to the buses and that Veerappa Pillai obtained the temporary and permanent permits only in his capacity as transferee and not in his individual right."
RLC,"To quote the learned Chief Justice:""the conduct of the parties, the attitude of the transport authorities including the Government are all explicable only on the assumption that the rights of parties were consequent on the ownership of the five vehicles in question."
ARG,Mr. Setalvad appearing for the appellant urged two narrower grounds as sufficient for his purposes.
ARG,"Firstly, he urged that however wide the jurisdiction of the High Court might be under Article 226, it could never exer cise its powers under the article in such a manner as to convert itself into a court of appeal sitting in judgment over every tribunal or authority in the State discharging administrative or quasi judicial functions."
ARG,"Secondly, he maintained that the Motor Vehicles Act with the rules framed thereunder dealing with the grant of permits is a self contained code and that in respect of the rights and liabil ities created by such a statute the manner of enforcement must be sought within the statute itself."
ARG,"It was further urged by him that in any event, the High Court could not substitute its own view or discretion for the view taken or discretion exercised by the specified authorities, even if it was erroneous or unsound."

RLC,"428 The propriety of the decision of the High Court so far as it relates to the appellant has been challenged before us in this appeal and Mr. Sinha, who appeared in support of the same, raised before us a two fold contention; his first and main contention is that as the contempt in this case was said to have been committed in respect of a court subordi nate to the High Court and the allegations made in the article in question constitute an offence under section 499 of the Indian Penal Code, the jurisdiction of the High Court to take cognizance of such a case is expressly barred under section 2 (3) of the Contempt of Courts Act."

ARG,On these allegations the plaintiffs prayed that: (1) the properties described in the schedule to the plaint as well as other properties under the management of the defendant be declared to be religious and charitable trust properties of the Kaivalya or Karuna sagar Panth; 515 (2) the defendant be removed from the Gadi and posses sion of the properties and a suitable successor appointed in his place; (3) the defendant be called upon to render accounts for the period of his management; and (4) a scheme might be framed for proper management of the institution.
ARG,The defendant in his written statement traversed all the material allegations in the plaint and contended infer alia that the suit was not maintainable inasmuch as no public trust of a religious and charitable character existed in respect to the suit properties which were the private properties of the defendant himself.

RLC,The High Court holds that this is proved and holds further that this preceded the firing by the appellant.
RLC,There is a hole in the wall between the two portions of the building in which these two shops are situate and the High Court holds that Zahid 's family got into the appel lant 's portion of the building through this hole and took refuge there.
RLC,The High Court also holds that the appel lant 's mother then told the appellant that the crowd had burst into his (appellant 's) shop and was looting it.
RLC,The learned Judges state that what he said was not quite true because all that the crowd did was to beat the door of the appellant 's shop with lathis as they were passing but had not broken into the shop.
RLC,But they accept the fact that the crowd was beating the doors of the appellant 's shop with their lathis.

RLC,"The learned District Judge on appeal reversed this decision and allowed the defendant the amount claimed by him by way of equitable set off, subject, however, to the condition that the dues of the defendant should be deducted from the dues of the plaintiff till the defendant 's dues were wiped off."
RLC,"The relevant part of his judgment runs thus : ""The broad fact is that they (plaintiffs) have been in possession of the lands since 1910 and have been in enjoy ment of rent from the tenants from that date and according to law they are not entitled to possess the land uncondi tionally."
RLC,Now that all the facts are before the court and the time has come for final adjustment of accounts between the parties the court should try to do substantial justice between the parties.

COUNSEL,"951 K.S. Krishnaswami Aiyangar (K. Narasimha Aiyangar, with him) for respondent No. 1. 1950."
JUDGE,The Judgment of the Court was delivered by MUKHERJEA J.
RLC,"This appeal is directed against an appellate judgment of a Division Bench of the Madras High Court dated November 27, 1945, reversing the decision of the Subordinate Judge of ' Mayuram made in Original Suit No. 34 of 1943."
RLC,The first court accepted the contention of the defendant No. 1 and dismissed the plaintiff 's suit.
RLC,"On appeal to the High Court, the judgment was reversed and the plaintiff 's claim was allowed."
RLC,"The High Court on a construction of the will has found in favour of the plaintiff primarily on the ground that in the contingency which happened in the present case, viz., that the widow took in adoption a nephew 's son of the testa tor, paragraph 5 of the will did not come into operation at all."
RLC,"An Obvious difficulty, according to the learned Judges, in accepting the construction sought to be put upon the will by defendant No. 1 is that paragraph 5 speaks both of Kothan gudi and Injigudi properties, whereas paragraph 13 does not mention the Injigudi house at all, nor does it purport to give a life interest in the same to Nagammal."
RLC,The result was that the plaintiff 's claim was allowed.
ARG,"In course of the arguments, we have been referred by the learned Counsel on both sides to quite a large 955 number of decided authorities, both English and Indian, in support of their respective contentions."
NAME,"Yeswant Deorao Deshmukh vs Walchand Ramchand Kothari on 1 December, 1950"
CITATION,"Equivalent citations: 1951 AIR 16, 1950 SCR 852"
COUNSEL,"K. section Krishnaswami Aiyangar (K. Narasimha Aiyangar, with him) for the appellant."
COUNSEL,"M.C. Setalvad, Attorney General for India, (B. Sen, with him) for the respondent."
JUDGE,The Judgment of the court was deliv ered by CHANDRASEKHARA AIYAR J.
RLC,"On appeal to the High Court Chagla C.J. and Dixit J. reversed this decision, holding that it was not a condi tional decree, that the steps taken by Tendulkar to execute this decree were of no avail, and that the insolvency pro ceedings were for a 855 different relief altogether, so that section 14 (2) of the Limitation Act could not be invoked."
RLC,"They concurred with the finding of the Subordinate Judge that the judgment debtor prevented the execution of the decree within 12 years by fraudulent concealment of his ownership of the 'Prabhat ' newspaper and that the twelve years ' bar of limi tation did not apply; but they held that the application was barred under article 182 of the Limitation Act, as more than three years had run from 9th September, 1940, the date of the dismissal of the previous execution application, before the present application was filed on 4th October, 1946."
ARG,The learned Advocate for the appellant therefore devot ed most of his argument to the fourth contention set forth above.
RLC,"After referring to the stratagem adopted by the judgment debtor in Bhagu Jetha vs Malick Bawasaheb(1), the learned Judges observed: ""In this case, in our opinion, the stratagem is much more dishonest."
RLC,"The attempt on the part of the judgment debtor was to conceal his property, to deny its ownership and to put forward a mere benamidar as the real owner of that property."
RLC,"In our opinion, therefore, the execution of the decree is not barred under section 48."
ARG,""" On the strength of this concurrent finding, Mr. Krish naswami Iyengar for the appellant argued that the fraud fell within the scope of section 18 of the Limitation Act and that if it were so, he was out of the woods, inasmuch as the proper article to apply would be article 181 of the/imita tion Act."
ARG,"The right to apply accrued to him when the fraud became known to him in or about June, 1946. 'Till then he was kept by the fraud from the knowledge of his right to make an application against the property."
STATUTE,There can be no question that the conduct of the re spondent was fraudulent within the meaning of section 48 (2) of the Civil Procedure Code.
ARG,"Mr. Setalvad, the learned Attorney General, who appeared for the respondent, pointed out that there 859 was no benami purchase and that the holding out of Abhyankar as the proprietor of the ' Prabhat ' did not amount to any false representation or misrepresentation to the judgment creditor, as the accounts on which reliance was placed were accounts opened in the banks and were not ordinarily avail able for inspection by third parties."
STATUTE,"Section 48, Civil Procedure Code (which corresponds to section 230 of the Code of 1882), is in these terms: "" 48."
STATUTE,"(1) Where an application to execute a decree not being a decree granting an injunction has been made, no order for the execution of the same decree shall be made upon any fresh application presented after the expiration of 12 years from (a) the date of the decree sought to be executed, or (b) where the decree or any subsequent order directs, any payment of money or the delivery of any property to be made at a certain date or at recurring periods the date of the default in making the payment of delivery in respect of which the applicant seeks to execute the decree."
STATUTE,"(2) Nothing in this section shall be deemed (a) to preclude the Court from ordering the executior of a decree upon an application presented after the expiration of the said term of twelve years, where the 860 judgment debtor has by fraud or force prevented the execu tion of the decree at some time within twelve years immedi ately before the date of the application; or (b) to limit or otherwise affect the operation of arti cle 183 of the first Schedule to the Indian Limitation Act, 1908."
STATUTE,""" Section 18 of the Limitation Act, 1908, runs thus: "" 18."
STATUTE,"Where any person having a right to institute a suit or make an application has, by means of fraud, been kept from the knowledge of such right or of the title on which it is founded, or where any document necessary to establish such right has been fraudulently concealed from him, the time limited for instituting a suit or making an application (a) against the person guilty of the fraud or accessory thereto, or (b) against any person claiming through him other wise than in good faith and for a valuable consideration, shall be computed from the time when the fraud first became known to the person injuriously affected thereby, or, in the case of the concealed document, when he first had the means of producing it or compelling its production."" Whether the fraud of the judgment debtor should actually prevent the execution of the decree or whether it is enough if the fraud has been committed without esulting in actual prevention is a question on which there has been some diver gence of opinion in the decided cases."
STATUTE,Section 18 of the Limitation Act postulates the former alternative.
STATUTE,"It is true that articles 181 and 182 of the Limitation Act and section 48, 864 Civil Procedure Code, should be read together."
ARG,"The learned Advocate of the appellant asked how it could be possible for him to apply in execution when there was the fraud and whether the law contemplated that, even though the fraud prevented execution of the decree, he was to go on filing useless or futile applications every three years merely for keeping the decree alive."
STATUTE,The third column in article 182 prescribes the starting point of limitation under different specified circumstances.
STATUTE,"It does not, and indeed need not, mention the ground of fraud because if fraud of the kind against which the Limitation Act contem plates relief, as prescribed in section 18 of the Limitation Act, is established, the time is automatically altered by operation of that section."
STATUTE,"In our opinion, therefore, the conten tion that because of the fraud established in the present case under section 48(2) of the Civil Procedure Code, the appellant gets a fresh starting point of limitation under article 182 of the Limitation Act is unacceptable."
FACTS,"For the assessment year 1940 41 the net income of the assessee under the head ""property"" was computed by the Income tax Officer in the sum of Rs. 6,21,764 after deducting from gross rents certain payments.  "
REASONING,There is no question of any capital or other expenditure on the property. 
RPC,"We are therefore of opinion that capital charge here could only mean a charge created for a capital sum, i.e., a charge to secure the discharge of a liability of a capital nature. "
PRECEDENT,In 1933 the Privy Council decided the case of Bijoy Singh. 
PRECEDENT,"Dudhuria vs Commissioner of Income tax, Calcutta (1 ). "
PRECEDENT,It was not an assessment under section 9 but an assessment on the general income of an assessee who was liable to pay maintenance for his step mother which had been charged on all his assets by a decree of Court. 
PRECEDENT,It was not a liability voluntarily incurred by him but one cast on him by law.
PRECEDENT,The Privy Council held that the amount paid by him in discharge of that liability formed no part of his real income and so should not be included in his assessment. 
PRECEDENT,"Though the decision proceeded on the principle that the outgoings were not part of the assessee 's income at all, the framers of the amending Act of 1939 wanted, apparently, to extend the principle, so far as the assessment of property was concerned, even to cases where obligatory payments had to be made out of the assessee 's income from the property charged with such payments, and the second sub clause, namely, ""where the property is subject to an annual charge not being a capital charge, the amount of such charge"" was added. "
PRECEDENT,"In Commissioner of Income tax, Bombay vs Mahomedbhoy Rowji (1), a Bench of the Bombay High Court considered the meaning of these words. "
PRECEDENT,"It is therefore clear that there is no conflict of judicial deci sions as to the meaning of the phrase ""annual charge"" occur ring in section 3 (1) (iv) and the meaning given is the natural meaning of these words."
PRECEDENT,"As to the phrase ""capital charge"", Beaumont C.J. in the case above referred to took the view that the words mean a charge on capital. "
PRECEDENT,In the Allahabad judgment under appeal these (1) I.L.R. (2) I.L.R. 1944 All.
PRECEDENT,558 words were considered as not meaning a charge on capital. 
PRECEDENT,"It was said that if an annual charge means a charge to secure the discharge of an annual liability, then, capital charge means a charge to secure the discharge of a liability of a capital nature. "
RPC,We think this construction is a natu ral construction of the section and is right. 
RPC,"The determination of the point whether the taxes in dispute fall within the ambit of the phrase ""annual charge not being a capital charge"" depends on the provisions of the statutes under which they are levied."
PRECEDENT,"In Commissioner of Income tax, Bombay vs Mahomedbhoy Rowji(1) Beaumont C.J., while rejecting the claim for the deduction of the taxes, placed reliance on (1) I.L.R. 561 section 9 (1) (v) which allows a deduction in respect of any sums paid on account of land revenue. "
PRECEDENT,It was observed that land revenue stands on the same footing as municipal taxes and that as the legislature made a special provision for deduction of sums payable in regard to land revenue but not in respect of sums paid on account of municipal taxes that circumstance indicated that the deduction was not allowable. 
PRECEDENT,"For the same purpose reference was also made to the provi sions of section 10 which deal with business allowances and wherein deduction of any sum paid on account of land reve nue, local rates or municipal taxes has been allowed."
PRECEDENT,In the concluding part of his judgment the learned Chief Jus tice said that it was not necessary for him to consider what the exact meaning of the words was and that it was suffi cient for him to say that it did not cover municipal taxes which are made a charge on the property under section 212 of the Bombay Municipal Act. 
REASONING,"562 Kania J. in the above case in arriving at his conclusion was influenced by the consideration that these taxes were of a variable character, i.e., liable to be increased or reduced under the various provisions of the Municipal Act and that the charge was in the nature of a contingent charge."
PRECEDENT,"In Moss Empires Ltd. vs Inland Revenue Commissioners (1) it was held by the House of Lords that the fact that certain payments were contingent and variable in amount did not affect their character of being annual payments and that the word, ""annual"" must be taken to have the quality of being recurrent or being capable of recurrence. "
PRECEDENT,"In Cunard 's Trustees vs Inland Revenue Commissioners (2) it was held that the payments were capable of being recur rent and were therefore annual payments within the meaning of schedule D, case III, rule 1 (1), even though they were not necessarily recurrent year by year and the fact that they varied in amount was immaterial. "
RPC,The Allahabad High Court (1) (2) [1948] 1 A.E.R. 150. (3) I.L.R. (4) I.L.R. 563 in Gappumal Kanhaiya Lal vs Commissioner of Incometax (1) (the connected appeal) took a correct view of this matter and the reasoning given therein has our approval. -
RPC,The result is that this appeal is allowed and the two questions which were referred to the High Court by the Income tax Tribunal and cited above are answered in the affirmative. 
RPC,The appellants will have their costs in the appeal.
FACTS,835 the Deoshis agreed inter alia to pay royalty at the rate of 2a. per ton on all classes of coal raised subject to a minimum of Rs. 750 a year.
FACTS,"The Singhs feeling themselves aggrieved by the latter transaction brought a title suit (No. 1291 of 1921) in the Court of the Subordinate Judge of Dhanbad for a declaration of their title and for possession of the 500 bighas leased to the Deoshis under the aforesaid patta of 7th June, 1921."
FACTS,"The patta which defend ant No. 3 executed in favour of the plaintiffs in respect of 5,800 bighas of coal land in village Rahraband shall remain in force, and the plaintiffs will get a decree of declara tion of their right and title to the 500 bighas of coal land in dispute but defendants 1 and 2 (the Deoshis) shall hold possession as tenants."
FACTS,"Besides the terms mentioned below, defendants 1 and 2 shall remain bound by all the remaining terms under which they took settlement of the 500 bighas of coal land from defendant No. 3 under 836 patta and Kabuliyat, and both the defendants 1 and 2 shall possess the same under the plaintiffs from generation to generation and all the terms of the said patta and Kabuliyat shall remain effective and in force between them."
FACTS,"If the defendant No. 3 does not execute the parts on the aforesaid modified terms in favour 'of the plaintiffs within the time aforesaid and both the defendants 1 and 2 also do not execute a kabuliyat on the aforesaid modified terms, then this very rafanama shall be treated as the parts and kabuliyat, and the plaintiffs in accordance with the terms of the rafanama shall pay to defendant No. 3, Rs. 6,000 only as minimum royalty and commission at the rate of la."
FACTS,per ton to 2a.
RPC,"The answer to this contention is, as I have stated just now, to be found in the Full Bench decision of this court :"" [see Charu Chandra Mitra 's case ()]."
RPC,It was there held that a mere alteration of the rent reserved does not make the transaction a new lease so as to bring it within clause (d)of subsection (1).
RPC,We are unable to share this view.
REASONING,"It oversimplifies the compromise transaction which, in our opinion, involves much more than a mere alteration of the royalties stipulated for in the previous pattas executed by Kumar."
PRECEDENT,"As pointed out by the Judicial Committee in Hemanta Kumar 's case (1) ""An agreement for a lease, which a lease is by the statute declared to include, must, in their Lordships ' opinion, be a document which effects an actual demise and operates as a lease ."
PRECEDENT,"The phrase which in the context where it occurs and in the statute in which it is found, must in their opinion relate to some document which creates a present and immediate interest in the land."
RPC,Until the payment was made it was impossible to determine whether there would be any under lease or not.
RPC,Such a contingent agreement is not within clause (d) and although it is covered by clause (b). is excepted by clause (vi) of sub section ( '2).
RPC,We therefore agree with the conclusion of the High Court though on dif ferent grounds and dismiss the appeal with costs.
RPC,Appeal dismisseel.
PRECEDENT,"The gist of the numer ous decisions on this subject was clearly summed up by Viscount Simon in Watt vs Thomas(2), and his observations were adopted and reproduced in extenso by the Judicial Committee in a very recent appeal from the Madras High Court(3)."
PRECEDENT,"Like other tribunals, he may go wrong on a question of fact, but it is a cogent circumstance that a Judge of first instance, when (1) Vide Lord Atkin 's observations in W.C. Macdonald vs Fred Latinmer, AI.R. 1929 P.C. 15, 18."
PRECEDENT,""" It is in the light of these observations that we propose to examine the propriety of the decision of the s learned Judges of the High Court in the present case."
FACTS,"After the draft was fair copied and stamped, the witness signed it as the scribe and then it was taken by Bhikhi Ram and Ghur Lal to the Kot or palace of the Raja for his signature."
PRECEDENT,"The learned Judges seem to think that the plaintiff was not really at the spot when the mortgage deed was executed and as Bhikhi Ram was dead, this story was manufactured by the plaintiff in order to Vide the observations of Lord Carson in Nether landsche Handel Maatschappij v, R.M.P. Chettiar Firm and Others, A.I.R 1929 P.O. 202, 205."
REASONING,We see nothing improbable in the story that it was out of deference to the wishes of the Raja that the plaintiff consented to the document being scribed by Jawala Prasad Patwari.
RPC,The result is that the appeal must be allowed and the judgment of the High Court should be 792 set aside.
RPC,"As the High Court, however, has dismissed the suit only on the ground of non attestation of the mortgage bond and did not consider the other points which were raised before it, the case must go back to that court in order that the other matters, which have been left undecided, may be heard and decided by the learned Judges and the case dis posed of in accordance with law."
RPC,The plaintiff appellant is entitled to costs of this hearing as well as the costs of the High Court against defendant No. 1.
RPC,Appeal allowed.
FACTS,"On the 5th August, 1935, the first respondent filed an application under Order XXI, rule 90, and section 47 of the Code of Civil Procedure, to set aside the sale held in July, 1935, alleging certain irregularities in the conduct of the sale."
FACTS,"Subsequently, two appeals were filed on behalf 809 of the respondents (who will hereinafter be sometimes re ferred to as judgment debtors), one against the order refus ing to set aside the sale under Order XXI, rule 90 of the Civil Procedure Code, and the other against the order dis missing the application under the Madras Act."
FACTS,per annum from the date of sale till the date of payment.
FACTS,"How far this belated application affects the right claimed by the judg ment debtors under the Act is one of the questions raised in these appeals, and I shall deal with it after referring to the material provisions of the Act and the findings of the High Court which have given rise to several debatable points."
REASONING,"The second point is equally unsubstantial, be cause it is well settled that the owner of a property does not cease to be its owner merely because it is placed in the hands of a receiver."
PRECEDENT,""" In Bhawani Kunwar vs Mathurn Prasad Singh(1) the ques tion as to when a mortgagee who has purchased certain vil lages in execution of the decree acquired title to the properties purchased by him directly arose for considera tion, and the Privy Council rightly pointed (1) T.L.R. 816 out that ""the sale in execution of the mortgage decree took effect from the actual date of the sale and not from its confirmation."" In a simple case, the provisions cited above should settle the controversy, but, in the present case, the matter has been complicated on account of the appeal against the order refusing to set aside the sale under Order XXI, rule 90."
PRECEDENT,"In such a case, generally speaking, the true position seems to be that there is no finality until the litigation is finally determined by the appellate Court."
PRECEDENT,"This principle has been recognized in a number of cases, but it will be enough to cite Chandramani Shaha vs Anarjan Bibi(1)."
PRECEDENT,"by the purchaser for delivery of possession runs from the date of the order on appeal; the High Court having under the Code of Civil Proce dure, 1908, the same powers as the Subordinate Judge, the 'time when the sale becomes absolute ', for the purpose of article 180 is when the High Court disposes of the appeal."" Under article 180 of the Indian Limitation Act, the period of limitation runs ""from the date when the sale becomes absolute."
PRECEDENT,""" If we give a narrow and literal meaning to these words, the period of limitation should be held to run from the date when the original Court of execution confirms the sale."
PRECEDENT,"But, as was pointed out by the Privy Council, the High Court as an appellate Court had the same powers as the trial Court and it is only when the appeal was dismissed by the High Court that the order of the trial Court confirming the sale became absolute."
PRECEDENT,"Till the deci sion of the appellate Court, no finality was attached to the order confirming the sale."
REASONING,"If by reason of the confirmation of sale and satisfac tion of the decree having been entered up, the title to the village had passed indefeasibly to the decreeholder, there was no longer any decree or decree debt to be scaled down."
RPC,"After the sale in 1935, the only interest which the judgment debtors had in the village was to have the sale set aside, under the rele vant provisions of the Civil Procedure Code."
RPC,"This interest is not the interest contemplated by section 3, sub clause (ii) (a) & (b) of the Act which speaks of a 821 saleable interest or interest as a tenant, ryot or underten ure holder."
RPC,I agree in the conclusion reached by my learned broth er.
RPC,Appeals allowed.
FACTS,"1683, 1720, 1735 and 1757 of 1939 for the said aggregate sum of Rs. 1,80,000 and the interest thereon AND WHEREAS the said Mills have been advised to settle the said suits amicably AND WHEREAS the Calcutta Agency Limited by its Directors, S.N. Mitter or S.C. Mitter, having been and being still the Managing Agents of the said Mills have undertaken to reimburse the said Mills in respect of the decrees to be made in the said four suits in the manner hereinafter appearing NOW THESE PRESENTS WITNESS AND IT IS HEREBY AGREED AND DECLARED (i) That out of the commission of 3% payable by the said Mills to the said Agency under Regulation 131 of the Arti cles of Association of the Company, the Company shall have paramount lien on and deduct and set off a moiety thereof against any payment which the said Mills may make in respect of the decrees or any of them and/or costs of the said suits."
FACTS,"(5) Besides, the Tribunal was of the opinion that in this case it was not a revenue ex penditure at all."
FACTS,"As the payment had to be made towards liquidation of the decretal amount the Tribunal held, in the circumstances of this case, that it was a capital payment."
PRECEDENT,"Therefore this case is covered by the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Mitchell ' scase(1) . ""Applying this line of reasoning the High Court differed from the conclusion of the Tribunal and allowed the deduction to the respondent company under sec tion 10(2) (xv) of the Income tax Act, as claimed by the respondents."
PRECEDENT,"The Commissioner of Income tax, West Bengal, has come in appeal to us."
REASONING,The High Court fell into a grave error in omitting first to ascertain what were the facts found in the case stated by the Tribunal.
PRECEDENT,Reliance was placed for this contention on Raja Bijoy Singh Dudhuria 's case(1).
PRECEDENT,The contention was rejected.
RPC,"In our opinion, therefore, this appeal should be allowed on the simple ground that the facts neces sary to be established by the respondents to support their claim for exemption under section 10(2)(xv)of the Indian Income tax Act have not been established at any stage of the proceedings and therefore they are not entitled to the deduction claimed."
RPC,The appeal is therefore allowed with costs here and before the High Court.
FACTS,"The appellant appealed to the Commissioner against the assessment and the penalty levied upon him, but his appeal was dismissed on the 6th June, 1946."
FACTS,"803 At the commencement of the hearing of the appeal in this Court, a preliminary objection was raised by the learned counsel for the respondent that this appeals was not compe tent, and, on hearing both the parties, we are of the opin ion that the objection is wellfounded."
PRECEDENT,"In Sri Mahanth Harihar Gir vs Commissioner of Income tax, Bihar and Orissa (1) it was held by a special Bench of the Patna High Court that no appeal lay to His Majesty in Council under clause 31 of the Letters Patent of the Patna High Court, from an order of the High Court dismissing an application under section 66 (3) of the Income tax Act, (a provision similar to section 21 of the Act before us) to direct the Commissioner of Income tax to state a case."
PRECEDENT,"In that case, the whole law on the subject has been clearly and exhaustively dealt with, and it has been pointed out that the view taken by the Full Bench of the Lahore High Court in the case cited by the appellant was not supported by sever al other High Courts and that the Privy Council also, when the matter came before it, refrained from expressing any opinion as to its correctness."
PRECEDENT,"This question has been fully dealt with in Tata Iron and Steel Company vs Chief Revenue Authority, Bombay(1), where Lord Atkinson pointed out that the order made by the High Court was merely advisory and quoted the following observations of Lord Esher in In re Knight and the Tabernacle Permanent Building Society(2): ""In the case of Ex parte County Council of Kent, where a statute provided that a case might be stated (1) at 617. 805 for the decision of the Court it was held that though the language might prima facie import that there has to be the equivalent of a judgment or order, yet when the context was looked at it appeared that the jurisdiction of the Court appealed to was only consultative, and that there was noth ing which amounted to a judgment or order."
REASONING,But the High Court acquired jurisdiction to deal with the case by virtue of an express provision of the Bihar Sales Tax Act.
RPC,Appeal dismissed.
FACTS,Janki 's husband married another wife and by her got a son named Babu Ram.
FACTS,Mithani came to hold the entire estate of her husband in the restricted rights of a Hindu widow.
FACTS,"On 27th October 1921, there was a transaction entered into between Babu Ram on his own behalf as well as guardian of infant Nand Lal on the One hand and Mst."
FACTS,"On 1st September 1938, Ram Gopal was added as a party defendant to the suit on the plaintiff 's application and he is defendant No. 6."
FACTS,"Ram Dayal, it was said, having purchased these properties execution of a money decree against Sunder Lal and his three sons acquired a valid title to them."
PRECEDENT,"It was held by the Privy Council as early as in the case of Tagore vs Tagore( '3) that if an estate were given to a man without express words of inheritance, it would, in the absence of a conflicting context, carry, by Hindu Law, an estate of inheritance."
PRECEDENT,(1) Vide Rajgndra Prasad vs Gopal Prasad.
REASONING,"The extent of interest, which the donee is to take, depends upon the intention of the donor as expressed by the language use, d, and if the dispositive words employed in the document are clear and unambiguous and import absolute ownership, the purpose of the grant would not, by itself, restrict or cut down the interest."
REASONING,"The desire to provide maintenance or residence of the donee would only show the motive which prompted the donor to make the gift, but it could not be read as a meas ure of the extent of the gift."
REASONING,"There a Hindu executed a registered deed of gift of certain properties in favour of his daughter in law for the"" support and maintenance"" of his daughter in law and declared that the donee should remain absolute owner of the property (malik mustaqil) and pay Government revenue."
REASONING,"These words, it was said, ""are quite capable of signifying that the gift was made for the purpose of enabling them to live in comfort and do not necessarily mean that it was to be limited to a bare right of maintenance."
PRECEDENT,""" On behalf of the respondent, reliance was placed upon the decision of the Judicial Committee in Raja Ram Buksh vs Arjun(1)in support of the contention that in a maintenance grant it is the prima facie intention of the gift that it should be for life."
PRECEDENT,"The case of Woodoya ditta Deb vs Mukoond(2), which was referred to and relied upon in the judgment of the Privy Council, was (1) 28 I.A, 1."
REASONING,Meria acknowledging her to be the owner of the property.
RPC,"The result is that the appeal is allowed, the judgment and decree of the High Court are set aside and those of the trial Judge restored."
RPC,The defendant No. 6 will have his costs from the plaintiff in all the courts.
RPC,There will be no order for costs as regards the other parties: 780 FAZL ALI J.
RPC,"I agree with the judgment delivered by my learned brother, Mukherjea J. CHANDRASEKHARA AIYAR J."
RPC,During the hearing of the appeal I entertained doubts whether the view taken by the High Court was not correct.
RPC,"But on further consideration, I find that it cannot be maintained, having regard to the terms of the ' Tamliknama ' (deed of transfer) in favour of Musammat Meria and the context in which it came into exist ence."
RPC,The name of the document or deed does not very much matter.
RPC,"Though the word ' malik ' is not a term of art, it has been held in quite a large number of cases, decided mostly by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, that the word, as employed in Indian documents, means absolute owner and that unless the context indicated a different meaning, its use would be sufficient to convey a full title even without the addition of the words, ' heirs ', or ' son ', ' grandson ' and ' great grandson '."
RPC,"Of course, if there are other clauses in the document which control the import of the word and restrict the estate to a limited one, we must give the narrower meaning; otherwise the word must receive its full significance."
PRECEDENT,"Especially is this so, when the rule of interpretation laid down in Mohammed Shamsul vs Sewak Ram( ') has come to be regarded as unsound."
PRECEDENT,The language employed in the ' Tamliknama ' (exhibit II) is almost similar to the language of the deeds construed in Bhaidas Shivdas vs Bai Gulab & Another( '2) and Bishunath Prasad Singh vs Chandika Prasad Kumari and Others(s) where it was held that an absolute estate was conveyed.
RPC,I agree that the judgment and decree of the High Court should be set aside and that the decree of the trial Judge should be restored with costs to the appellant in all the Courts.
RPC,Appeal allowed.
FACTS,"This is said to be a test case, for, on its decision, we are told, depend the rights of numerous other persons whose interests are similar to those of the petitioner."
FACTS,There is no serious controversy as to the facts material for the purposes of this application.
FACTS,"Patiala and Nabha with the concurrence and guarantee of the Government of India entered into a covenant agreeing to unite and integrate their territories in one State with a common executive, legislature and judiciary by the name of Patiala and East Punjab States Union, hereinaf ter compendiously referred to as the Pepsu."
FACTS,"On November 14, 1948, the Commissioner of Income tax issued a Notification (No. 4, dated 132 29 7 2005) intimating that persons belonging to the Cove nanting States of Nabha and Nalagarh would be assessed to income tax under the Patiala Income Tax Act, 2001."
FACTS,"For the assessment year beginning on the 1st day of Baisakh, 2006, that is to say, in respect of the accounting the income, profits and gains of the previous year ending on the last day of Chet, 2005, (a) income tax shall be charged at the rates specified in Part I of the Second Schedule to this Ordinance, and (b) rates of super tax shall, for the purposes of sec tion 55 of the Patiala Income Tax Act, 2001, be specified in Part II of the Second Schedule to this Ordinance."
FACTS,""" It is in this setting that the facts leading to the present petition have to be considered."
FACTS,The petitioner is a resident of Ateli in the district of Mohindargarh now in Pepsu but which formerly formed part of the Nabha State.
FACTS,"On October '20, 1949, the petitioner was served with a notice under sections 22(2) and 88 of the Patiala Income Tax Act, 2001, requiring him to submit a return for the Income Tax year 2006 (13 4 1949 to 12 4 1950) disclosing his income during the previous year (13 4 1948 to 12 4 1949)."
FACTS,"The petitioner, on December 4, 1949, filed his return for the year 2006 and on February 14, 1950, he was assessed to income tax."
FACTS,"It is said that while the people of Kapurthala which is included in Pepsu have been asked to pay income tax for the period prior to August 20, 1948, at the old rate fixed by the Kapurthala Income Tax Act which was lower than the rate fixed by the Patiala Income Tax Act, 2001, the people of Nabha who had not to pay any income tax prior to August 20, 1948, at all have been made liable to pay at the higher Patiala rate and that such discrimination offends against the provisions of article 14."
RPC,"In the view we have taken, namely, that the protection against imposition or collection of taxes save by authority of law is secured by article 265 and not by article 31(1), the questions urged by Dr. Tek Chand do not really arise and it is not necessary to express any opinion on them on this application."
RPC,Those questions can only arise in appropriate proceedings and not on an applica tion under article 32.
RPC,In our judgment this application fails on the simple ground that no fundamental right of the petitioner has been infringed either under article 14 or under article 31(1) and we accordingly dismiss the petition with costs.
RPC,Petition dismissed.
FACTS,"KANIA C.J. This is an appeal under article 132 of the Constitution of India from the judgment of the 214 High Court at Calcutta, which rejected the habeas corpus petitions of the appellants."
REASONING,The result is that the appeal fails and is dismissed.
PRECEDENT,"This appeal was heard along with Case No. 22 of 1950 (The State of Bombay vs Atma Ram Sridhar Vaidya)(1), as the main question involved was the same."
RPC,"In my opinion the conclusions arrived at by Roxburgh J. were correct and well founded, and, therefore, this appeal should be dismissed."
RPC,Appeal dismissed.
FACTS,"The decision of these four ap peals, which are connected with each other and which have arisen out of orders made by the High Court of Patna in four Miscellaneous Appeals, depends on the interpretation of section 7 of the Bihar Moneylenders (Regulation of Transac tions) Act, 1939."
PRECEDENT,The decision of the Federal Court is reported in Ramnandan Prasad Narain Singh and Another vs Kulpati Shri Mahanth Goshwarni Madhwanand Ramji(1).
FACTS,"The case was remitted back to the High (1) 141 Court, giving liberty to the appellants to file an applica tion under section 13."
REASONING,"Adding an equal sum by way of interest which according to them was the maximum amount, permitted to be allowed under section 7 of the Act, the total liability was stated to be Rs. 56,300 and a charge was declared on the property for this amount."
PRECEDENT,The Federal Court held in Ramnandan Prasad Narain Singh and Another vs Kulpati Shri Mahanth Goshwami Madhwanand Ramji(1) that the judgment debtors (present appellants) were entitled to claim the benefit of the provi sions of the new Act when the executing court proceeded under section 13 to determine the value of the properties to be sold.
REASONING,"The second question raised on their behalf relates to the true meaning of section 7 of the Bihar Moneylenders (Regulation of Transactions) Act VII of 1939, which is in these terms: ""7."
PRECEDENT,"As pointed out by Sir Maurice Gwyer C.J. in Surendra Prasad Narain Singh vs Sri Gajadhar Prasad Sahu Trust Estate and Otherse), ""Section 7 of the Act of 1937 is no doubt extremely obscure and illdrawn."
PRECEDENT,"The point came up expressly for decision in Singhesh war Singh and Others vs Madni Prasad Singh Others(2) where a mortgage bond was executed on 31 8 1922 for a sum of Rs. 2,000 which was the balance of the principal and inter est due under a mortgage bond of the 11th of October, 1912, for (1) (2)A.T.R. 1940 Pat."
PRECEDENT,Gwyer C.J. points out this difficulty at page 59 in the case Surendra Prasad Narain Singh vs Sri Gajadhar Prasad Sahu Trust Estate and Others(4).
PRECEDENT,"It is pointed out by the learned (1) Vide Sasiman Chowdhurain vs Shib Narayan, 49 I.A, 25."
PRECEDENT,This was laid down in clear terms by the Judicial Committee in a comparatively recent case which is to be found reported in Bishunath Prasad vs Chandrika(1).
PRECEDENT,""" On behalf of the respondent, reliance was placed upon the decision of the Judicial Committee in Raja Ram Buksh vs Arjun(1)in support of the contention that in a maintenance grant it is the prima facie intention of the gift that it should be for life."
REASONING,"This principle bas obviously no application to cases of the type which we have before us and it was never so applied by the Privy Council, as would appear from the decision referred to above."
REASONING,"The learned Counsel for the plaintiff respondent drew our attention in this connection, to the fact that the properties given by the ,Tamliknama ' were valued at Rs. 8,000, whereas the entire estate left by Mangal Sen was worth Rs. 25,000 only."
REASONING,"As has been said already, Sunder Lal, the brother of Meria, was in occupation of the double storied shop from long before the Tamliknama was executed and Meria got any legal title to it."
REASONING,It appears from the record that in 1920 a suit was institut ed on behalf of the infant Nand Lal for evicting Sunder Lal from the shop and the allegation in the plaint was that Sunder Lal was occupying the property as a tenant since the time of Mst.
REASONING,Sunder Lal continued to be in occupation of the shop and executed a rent agreement in respect of the same in favour of Nand Lal promising to pay a rent of Rs. 12 per month.
REASONING,"By the deed of relinquishment, she renounced her claim for maintenance in respect of all the properties left by Mangal Sen including the two items which she got under the 'Tamliknama '."
RPC,"The result is that the appeal is allowed, the judgment and decree of the High Court are set aside and those of the trial Judge restored."
RPC,The defendant No. 6 will have his costs from the plaintiff in all the courts.
RPC,There will be no order for costs as regards the other parties: 780 FAZL ALI J.
RPC,"I agree with the judgment delivered by my learned brother, Mukherjea J. CHANDRASEKHARA AIYAR J."
RPC,During the hearing of the appeal I entertained doubts whether the view taken by the High Court was not correct.
RPC,"But on further consideration, I find that it cannot be maintained, having regard to the terms of the ' Tamliknama ' (deed of transfer) in favour of Musammat Meria and the context in which it came into exist ence."
RPC,The name of the document or deed does not very much matter.
RPC,"Though the word ' malik ' is not a term of art, it has been held in quite a large number of cases, decided mostly by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, that the word, as employed in Indian documents, means absolute owner and that unless the context indicated a different meaning, its use would be sufficient to convey a full title even without the addition of the words, ' heirs ', or ' son ', ' grandson ' and ' great grandson '."
RPC,"Of course, if there are other clauses in the document which control the import of the word and restrict the estate to a limited one, we must give the narrower meaning; otherwise the word must receive its full significance."
PRECEDENT,"Especially is this so, when the rule of interpretation laid down in Mohammed Shamsul vs Sewak Ram( ') has come to be regarded as unsound."
PRECEDENT,The language employed in the ' Tamliknama ' (exhibit II) is almost similar to the language of the deeds construed in Bhaidas Shivdas vs Bai Gulab & Another( '2) and Bishunath Prasad Singh vs Chandika Prasad Kumari and Others(s) where it was held that an absolute estate was conveyed.
RPC,I agree that the judgment and decree of the High Court should be set aside and that the decree of the trial Judge should be restored with costs to the appellant in all the Courts.
RPC,Appeal allowed.
RPC,"Accordingly, for the reasons indicated in that judgment, we allow this petition and hereby quash the impugned order of the Chief Commissioner, Delhi, dated the 2nd March, 1950. "
PRECEDENT,"(2) Romesh Thappar vs The State of Madras, supra p. 594. "
PRECEDENT,"The question raised in this case relates to the validity of 'section 7 (1) (c) of the East Punjab Public Safety Act, 1949 (as extended to the Province of Delhi), which runs as follows : ""The Provincial Government or any authority authorised by it in this behalf if satisfied that such action is neces sary for the purpose of preventing or combating any activity prejudicial to the public safety or the maintenance of public order, may, by order in writing addressed to a print er, publisher or editor * * * * (c) require that any matter relating to a particular subject or class of subjects shall before publication be submitted for scrutiny;"" It should be noted that the provisions of sub clause (c) arc not in general terms but are confined to a ""particular subject or class of subjects,"" and that having regard to the context in which these words are used, they must be connected with ""public safety or the maintenance of public order."
FACTS,The order in question recites among other things that the Chief Commissioner is satisfied that the Organizer has been publishing highly objectionable matter constituting a threat to public law and order and that action to which reference has been made is necessary for the purpose of preventing or combating activities 610 prejudicial to the public safety or the maintenance of public order. 
RPC,""" It is contended that section 7 (1)(c) of the Act, under which the impugned order has been made, cannot be saved by clause (2) of article 19 of the Constitution, because it does not relate to any matter which undermines the security of, or tends to overthrow, the State. "
RPC,Thus the main ground of attack is that the impugned law is an infringement of a fundamental right and is not saved by the so called saving clause to which reference has been made. 
RPC,"There can be no doubt that to impose pre censorship on a journal, such as has been ordered by the Chief Commissioner in this case, is a restriction on the liberty of the press which is included in the right to freedom of speech and expression guaranteed by article 19 (1) (a) of the Constitu tion, and the only question which we have therefore to decide is whether clause (2) of article 19 stands in the way of the petitioners. "
PRECEDENT,"The headnote of this case runs as follows ""By section 1 of the Defence of the Realm (Consolidation) Act, 1914, power was given to His Majesty in Council 'during the continuance of the present war to issue regulations  for securing the public safety and the defence of the realm ' : (1) 612 Held, that the regulations thereby authorized were not limited to regulations for the protection of the country against foreign enemies, but included regulations designed for the prevention of internal disorder and rebellion "" Thus 'public order ' and 'public safety ' are allied matters, but, in order to appreciate how they stand in relation to each other, it seems best to direct our atten tion to the opposite concepts which we may, for convenience of reference, respectively label as 'public disorder ' and 'public unsafety '. "
RPC,"I think that ""public order"" may well be paraphrased in the context as public tranquillity and the words ""public safety"" and ""public order"" may be read as equivalent to ""security of the State"" and ""public tranquillity."
PRECEDENT,"The latest pronouncement by the highest Indian tribunal as to the law of sedition is to be found in Niharendu Dutt Majumdar vs The King(1) which has been quoted again and again and in which Gwyer C.J. laid down that public disor der, or the reasonable anticipation or likelihood of public disorder, is the gist of the offence of sedition and ""the acts or words complained of must either incite to disorder or (1) 615 must be such as to satisfy reasonable men that is their intention or tendency. "
PRECEDENT,"Sullivan (1), and he also added that he was content to adopt ""the words of that learned Judge which are to be found in every book dealing with this branch of the criminal law."
PRECEDENT,""" There is no doubt that what Gwyer C.J. has stated in that case represents the view of a number of Judges and authors and was also the view of Sir James Stephen in regard to whom Cave J. in his charge to the jury in a case relating to the law of sedition JR. "
PRECEDENT,"vs Burns(2) said : ""The law upon the question of what is seditious and what is not is to be found stated very clearly in a book by Stephen J. who has undoubtedly a greater knowledge of crimi nal law than any other Judge who sits upon the Bench, and what he has said upon the subject of sedition was submitted to the other Judges, who sometime back were engaged with him in drafting a criminal code, and upon their report the Commissioners say that his statement of law appears to them to be stated accurately as it exists at present. "
PRECEDENT,""" The decision of Gwyer C.J. held the field for several years until the Privy Council, dealing with a case under the Defence of India Rules, expressed the view in King Emper or vs Sadhashiv Narayan Bhalerao(3) that the test laid down by the learned Chief Justice was not applicable in India where the offence under section 124A of the Indian Penal Code should be construed with reference to the words used in that section. "
PRECEDENT,(8) 74 I.A. 616 There can be no justification for restricting the contents of the section by the marginal note. 
RPC,"Both these classes of offences are such as will undermine the security of the State or tend to overthrow it if left unchecked, and, as I have tried to point out, there is a good deal of authorita tive opinion in favour of the view that the gravity ascribed to sedition is due to the fact that it tends to seriously affect the tranquillity and security of the State."
RPC,"In principle, then, it would not have been logical to refer to sedition in clause (2) of article 19 and omit matters which are no less grave and which have equal potentiality for undermining the security of the State."
RPC,"In my opinion, the law which is impugned is fully saved by article 19 (2) and if it cannot be successfully assailed it is not possible to grant the remedy which the petitioners are seeking here."
RPC,"In my opinion, there can be no doubt that the Chief Commissioner has purported to act in this case within the sphere within which he is permitted to act under the law, and it is beyond the power of this Court to grant the reliefs claimed by the petitioners."
RPC,"In these circumstances, I would dismiss the petitioners ' application. "
RPC,Petition allowed.
FACTS,"The Bombay Government authorities, however, took the view that the pamphlet was a ""news sheet"" within the meaning of section 2 (6) of the Indian Press (Emergency Powers) Act, 1931, and that as it had been published without the authori ty required by section 15 (1) of that Act, the petitioner had committed an offence punishable under section 18 (1) of the same Act."
FACTS,"A prosecution under that Act was accordingly started against the petitioner in the Court of the Chief Presidency Magistrate, Bombay, and was registered as Case No. 1102/P of 1949."
REASONING,"Indeed, the heading of Part III is ""Fundamental Rights""."
REASONING,"It must follow, therefore, that article 13(1) can have no retrospective effect but is wholly pro spective in its operation."
REASONING,Such laws exist for all past transactions and for enforcing all rights and liabilities accrued before the date of the Constitution.
REASONING,"As already explained, article 13 (1) only has the effect of nullifying or rendering all inconsistent existing laws ineffectual or nugatory and devoid of any legal force or binding effect only with respect to the exercise of fundamental rights on and after the date of the commencement of the Constitution."
RPC,"In view of that conclusion, we do not consider it necessary to examine the reasons of the High Court for its conclusion."
RPC,"In our opinion, therefore, this appeal fails, and is dismissed."
PRECEDENT,"This statement of law by Craies was referred to with approval and adopted by the Federal Court in J.K. Gas Plant Manufacturing Co., (Rampur) Ltd., and Others vs King Emper or."
PRECEDENT,"He says (in Kay vs Goodwin)(1): ,, The effect of repealing a statute is to obliterate it as completely from the records of the Parlia ment as if it had never been passed;and it must be consid ered as a law that never existed except for the purpose of those actions which were commenced, prosecuted and concluded whilst it was an existing law."" (P. 350)."
REASONING,"Again, Crawford in his book on ""Statutory Construction"" dealing with the general effect of the repeal of an Act states the law in America to be as follows: ' 'A repeal will generally, therefore, divest all incho ate rights which have arisen under the repealed statute, and destroy all accrued causes of action based thereon."
REASONING,Pending judicial pro ceedings based upon a statute cannot proceed after its repeal.
PRECEDENT,"In R. vs Mawgan (Inhabitants)(1) a presentment as to the non repair of a highway had been made under 13 Geo. 3, c. 78, section 24, but before the case came on to be tried, the Act was repealed."
REASONING,"It was urged in the first place that without there being a saving clause to govern article 13 (1), it can be so construed as to permit offences committed prior to the 26th January, 1950, to be punished."
REASONING,"The High Court has answered this question in the negative and, in my opinion, rightly."
REASONING,I am in respectful agreement with the observations of the learned Chief Justice of Bombay that it is difficult to believe that the Constituent Assembly contemplated that with regard to the laws which it was declaring to be void under article 13 all vested rights and all proceedings taken should be disturbed and affected by particular laws ceasing to be in force as a result of inconsistencies with the fundamental rights guaranteed to the citizens.
REASONING,"The contention of the learned Attorney General that the phraseology employed in article 13 (1) of the Constitution clearly indicates that there was no intention to give any retrospective operation to the provisions of Part III of the Constitution and that the declaration that laws repugnant to Part III of the Constitution are void only operates from 26th January, 1950, has, in my opinion, force."
REASONING,"On this construction of article 13 it cannot affect any past transactions, whether closed or inchoate."
REASONING,By the construction that I have placed on this article that incongruous result is avoided.
REASONING,"It was said that the word ""repeal"" was not used in the article but instead the expression ""void"" was employed therein by the draftsmen in order to include within its ambit cases of custom and usage where such custom and usage were also repugnant to the provisions of Part III of the Constitution."
RPC,For the reasons given above I see no force in this appeal and I would accordingly dismiss it.
RPC,MUKHERJEA J. I am in entire agreement with the view taken by my learned brother Fazl Ali J. in his judgment and I concur both in his reasons and his conclusion.
RPC,Appeal dismissed.
FACTS,The State of Bombay is the respondent.
FACTS,"The draft rules were promulgated by a notification issued on the 5th June, 1907."
REASONING,"On the BOth April, 1934, he requested the Collector to assess non agricultural assessment on these plots."
REASONING,The suit was resisted by the State Government on a number of grounds.
REASONING,"the Privy Council on the 15th 274 September, 1945."
REASONING,The appeal concerns the fur ther relief refused to the plaintiff in respect to the lands mentioned in schedule II.
REASONING,The Collector has 275 no option in the matter and as soon as an application is made to him he should proceed to make an assessment and levy it on the non agricultural lands.
RPC,Plaintiff 's suit to that extent fails.
RPC,For the reasons given above the appeal is allowed and the plaintiff 's suit is decreed with costs except in regard to the claim for damages in respect to the lands mentioned in schedule II.
RPC,The defendant is directed to make an assess ment on lands mentioned in schedule II in the same way as in respect of the lands mentioned in schedule I and levy the same and pay it to the plaintiff.
RPC,Appeal allowed.
FACTS,"Notwithstanding this deposit, the House Controller passed an order on the both November, directing the eviction of the respondents by 10th May, 1948, and holding that they had made themselves liable to eviction by reason ' of non payment of rent."
FACTS,"The appellants were thereafter granted leave to appeal by the High Court, and they have accordingly preferred this appeal."
REASONING,"In the second of the two cases I have mentioned it is an erroneous application of the formula to say that the tribunal cannot give themselves jurisdiction by wrongly deciding certain facts to exist, because the legis lature gave them jurisdiction to determine all the facts, including the existence of the preliminary facts on which the further exercise of their jurisdiction depends; and if they were given jurisdiction so to decide without any appeal being given, there is no appeal from such exercise of their jurisdiction."
RPC,"It seems to us that on this short ground this appeal must succeed, and we (1) , at p. 443."
RPC,"153 accordingly allow the appeal, set aside the judgment and decree of the High Court and restore the decree of the courts below."
RPC,The appellants will be entitled to costs throughout.
RPC,Appeal allowed.
FACTS,""" The 11th paragraph provides among other things that ""all matters, questions, disputes, differences and/or claims arising out of and/or concerning and/or in connection and/or in consequence of or relating to this Contract whether or not obligations of either or both parties under this contract be subsisting at the time of such disputes and whether or not this contract has been terminated or purport ed to be terminated or completed shall be referred to the arbitration of the Bengal Chamber of Commerce under the rules of its Tribunal of Arbitration for the time being in force and according to such rules the arbitration shall be conducted."
FACTS,"After this letter, some further correspondence followed between the two par ties, and finally a bill of difference amounting to Rs. 4,116 was submitted by the appellants to the respondents, who, in their turn, denied their liability to pay the sum."
FACTS,"On the 6th February, 1947, the Tribunal of Arbitration made an award to the effect that the due date of contract had been extended by mutual agreement up to the 31st July, 1946, and accordingly the respondents should pay to the appellants a sum of Rs. 4,116 together with interest at the rate of 4% per annum from the 10th August, 1946, until the date of the award."
REASONING,That dispute is certainly covered by the arbitration clause.
REASONING,"If, therefore, we come to the conclusion that both the disputes raised by the respondents fail within the scope of the arbitration clause, then there is an end of the matter, for the arbitrators would have jurisdiction to adjudicate on the disputes, and we are not concerned with any error of law or fact committed by them or any omission on their part to consider any of the matters."
RPC,"In the result, we allow this appeal, set aside the judgment of the appellate Bench of the High Court and re store the order of Sinha J."
RPC,The appellants will be entitled to their costs throughout.
RPC,MAHAJAN J. I agree with my brother Fazl Ali that this appeal be allowed with costs.
RPC,Appeal allowed.
FACTS,"Grounds of detention dated 11th March, 1950, were served on him on 3rd April, 1950."
FACTS,""" Additional or supplementary grounds were served on 5th August, 1950."
REASONING,The orders of deten tion expressly state that the Governor of Punjab was satis fied of their necessity and that they were made by his order.
REASONING,Let us now turn our attention to the main contentions.
REASONING,"According to him, he made an order even on 11 3 1950 for the supply of the grounds."
REASONING,""" We shall leave aside for the moment the supplementary grounds furnished later."
PRECEDENT,It was held by a majority of the Judges in Case No. 22 of 1950 (1) State of Bombay vs Atmaram Sridhar Vaidya [1951] S.C.R. 167.
REASONING,"We are not concerned so much with the earlier history of the detenus as with what happened to them under the Preven tive Detention Act, 1950."
REASONING,"On the other hand, the detenu 's complaint has throughout been that he was given no particulars at all till the 5th August, 1950."
RPC,Ordered accordingly.
RPC,I concur in the order proposed by my learned brother Chandrasekhara Aiyar J. DAS J.
RPC,"In view of the majority decision in Case No. 22 of 1950 (The State of Bombay vs Atma Ram Sridhar Acharya), I concur in the order proposed by my learned brother."
RPC,Order accordingly.
FACTS,The appellant was at all material times the General Manager of the Jagdishpur Zamindary Company (hereinafter referred to as the company) who were the lessees of a sugar factory referred to in these proceedings as the Bhita Sugar Factory.
FACTS,""" On the 6th December, 1947, when the officers named went to the factory to carry cut the aforesaid order, they were told by the appellant that he would do everything possible to obstruct the removal of the sugar, and accordingly it was found that the sugar godowns had been locked and the road leading to them blocked by heaps of coal, firewood and tins placed across, so as to make vehicular traffic impos sible."
REASONING,"The order of the 27th September, 1947, having thus remained inchoate and incomplete and so incapable of being carried out or contravened till the 5th December, 1947, it was submitted that no seizure and removal could be lawfully ordered on the basis of an anticipated contravention 310 of such an order, and that the officers concerned in the illegal and unauthorised removal of the sugar were not acting in the discharge of their public functions."
PRECEDENT,"Reference was made in this connection to the decisions of the Calcutta High Court in Lilla Singh vs Queen Empress(1) and Queen Empress vs Jogendra Nath Mukerjee(2) where it was held that the public function in the discharge of which a public servant was obstructed must be a legal or legitimately authorised function, in order that the obstruction might constitute an offence under section 186 of the Indian Penal Code."
RPC,The appeal is dismissed.
RPC,The appellant 's bail bond is cancelled and he is ordered to surrender.
RPC,Appeal dismissed.
FACTS,"Sewanarayan, who had three wives, died in 1836, leaving behind him his third wife, Muni Bibi, two daughters by his 334 predeceased wives, these being Jiban Kumari and Amrit Ku mari, and a mistress named Kissen Dasi."
FACTS,Muni Bibi and Jiban Kumari also became the she baits of the Thakur or deity with power to appoint their successors.
REASONING,"On the 31st August, 1938, the President of the Tribunal gave his decision, by which he substantially upheld the award of the Collector, but modified it in one respect only."
REASONING,"We have therefore to fall back upon the recitals in the documents, to ascertain the circumstances under which the documents, exhibits L and K, were executed, because it is well settled that if all the original parties to the trans action and those who could have given evidence on the rele vant points have passed away, a recital consisting of the principal circumstances of the case assumes greater impor tance and cannot be lightly set aside."
PRECEDENT,"[See Banga Chandra Dhar Biswas vs Jagat Kisore Chowdhuri(1) 1 It appears to us that the recitals in the documents afford valuable evidence, because the tenancies were created by two pious ladies who were keenly interested in the sheba of the deity and with regard to whom it was not suggested that they expected to derive any personal advantage from the transactions in question."
REASONING,"339 had been supplementing the income of the residue from her own properties for meeting the expenses of performing cer tain essential services to the deity, such as jatra, mahot sob, etc."
REASONING,"A reference to the arpannama shows that the house was in the possession of a, tenant even in 1848, and from the recitals in the document it is clear that what Muni Bibi contemplated was that the house should continue to remain in the possession of a tenant, and the rent of the house should be used for the sheba of the deity."
PRECEDENT,[See Bava Magniram Sitgram vs Kasturbhai Manibhai(1)].
REASONING,"On the other hand, we find that the permanent character of the lease was recognized in a deed executed by Gourimoni on the 18th October, 1873 (exhibit Y), and in a mortgage deed executed by Raghubar Dayal, the guardian of Gopaldas, on the 31st August, 1878."
RPC,In the result Appeal No. 96 also is dismissed.
RPC,"Having regard to the circumstances of the case, we shall make no order as to costs in either of these appeals."
RPC,Appeals dismissed.
RPC,Agent for the appellant in Civil Appeal No. 95 and respondent in Civil Appeal No. 96: Sukumar Ghose.
FACTS,"Likewise, the Receivers were agreeable to receive Rs. 48,000 from defendants 3 to 7 and to release them and their proper ties from the decretal debt."
FACTS,"With regard to defendant No. 1, the proposal, which seems to have been accepted by the Receivers, was that the amount payable by him under the decree was to be settled at Rs. 37,500 and one Yacob Nadar would 'pay this amount on his behalf on consideration of the decree against defendant No. 1 being assigned to him by the Receivers excluding the rights of the latter to execute the decree against defendants 2 to 7 as scaled down by the High Court."
FACTS,"The position taken up by defendant No. 1, in substance, was that the mortgage debt was one and indivisible and even though different amounts were mentioned as payable by two groups of defendants in the decree, the decree holders were bound under the terms of the decree to release the entire mortgaged property even on payment of the amount directed to be paid by defendants 2 to 7."
FACTS,"In other words, even though the defendant No. 1 's application for relief under the Madras Agriculturists ' Relief Act was expressly rejected and he was held liable for the entire amount of the mortgage debt, he would still be entitled to avail himself of the benefit of the scaling down of the decree in favour of defendants 2 to 7."
PRECEDENT,"The reason for taking this view was thus given by the learned Judges in Arunachalam Pillai vs Seetharam(1), where the purchase of the equity of redemp tion was at an execution sale: ""When the 12th respondent purchased the properties in court auction, he took them subject to the burden of the appellant 's mortgage and if the burden is by reason of the provisions of section 8 refer.red to above reduced without pay ment, the purchase proves to that (1) 301 extent an advantageous one, and there is nothing in the Act to deprive him of the fruits of his."
PRECEDENT,""" A somewhat different reason was assigned in Pachigola vs Karatam(1) which however was a case where a portion of the."
RPC,Our conclusion is that the view taken by the District Judge was right and should not have been disturbed.
RPC,"The result is that the appeal is allowed, the order of the High Court is set aside and that of the District Judge restored."
RPC,We make no order as to costs of this appeal.
RPC,Appeal allowed.
FACTS,This appeal arises out of Suit No. 9 of 1939 instituted in the Court of the Subordinate Judge of Palamau by the appellants against the respondents for a number of declarations in respect to the title to certain lands and for an injunction restraining the respondents from proceed ing with a rent suit.
FACTS,"The mokarrari interest eventually devolved on three branches of the Singha family, each branch getting in the following proportions: Parameshwar Dayal and others, defendants ' first party, to the extent of six annas; Bisheswar Dayal Singh, defendants ' second party, to the extent of eight annas; and Madho Saran Singh, to the extent of two annas."
FACTS,"Subsequently, the two anna share of Madho Saran Singh was purchased by Hiranand Jha, father of the plaintiffs, jointly with."
FACTS,He already held the mokarrari interest to the same extent which had devolved on him by inheritance.
FACTS,"In the year 1918, Title Suit No. 59 of 1918 was insti tuted in the court of the Subordinate Judge of Palamau for partition of the lands situate in several villages and belonging to the family of the defendants ' first and second parties."
FACTS,"The Jhas were impleaded as defendants in ' the suit, being co sharers in part of the property in suit."
FACTS,"This suit was decreed in the year 1921, and in the final partition an allotment of two annas share in Darha village was made in their favour."
FACTS,"It appears that some time about the year 1926 the lakhraj interest holders, i.e., the Pathaks and Bisheshwar Dayal Singh, were in default in the payment of the cess due to Government."
REASONING,"An inter se partition of the mokarrari interest amongst the mokarrari dars as alleged by the plaintiffs could not affect their liability qua the lessor for the payment of the whole rent, as several tenants of a tenancy in law constitute but a single tenant, and qua the landlord they constitute one person, each constituent part of which possesses certain common rights in the whole and is liable to discharge common obligations in its entirety."
REASONING,Similarly the allegation of partition inter se among the several owners of the lakhraj holding could not in any way affect the integri ty of the lease in the absence of an allegation of a fresh contract between the split up owners of the holding and the different owners in the mokarrari interest.
RPC,"In view of our decision that the doctrine of merger has no application to the facts of the case, the plaintiffs ' case is bound to fail."
RPC,We accordingly hold that there is no substance in this appeal and we dismiss it with costs.
RPC,Appeal dismissed.
FACTS,"The term of the lease was to expire on the 2nd 222 December, 1945, unless the lessees gave to the land lords three months previous notice in writing of their intention of exercising their option of renewal of the lease for a further period of two years."
REASONING,We should not howev er be taken to concur in all the reasons given by the High Court for reversing that finding.
REASONING,"225 Explanation In any case where there is a dispute as to the amount of standard rent or permitted increases recovera ble under this Act the tenant shall be deemed to be ready and willing to pay such amount if, before the expiry of the period of one month after notice referred to in sub section (2), he makes an application to the court under sub section (3) of section 11 and thereafter pays or tenders the amount or rent or permitted increases specified in the order made by the court."
PRECEDENT,"The opinion expressed by the Division Bench on the construction of sections 12 and 50 of the Act was questioned in Nilkanth vs Rasiklal (J), and the matter was referred to a Full Bench."
RPC,In our opinion this contention is not sound.
RPC,We accordingly set aside the decree of the High Court dismissing the plaintiff 's suit and restore the decree of the trial Judge decreeing the plain tiff 's suit with costs.
RPC,Appeal allowed.
PRECEDENT,"In support of his contention about the invalidity of the East Punjab Public Safety Act and its provisions as regards externment, counsel for the petitioner relied on the recent unreported judgments of the Patna High Court in Miscellaneous Judicial Case No. 29 of 1950, Brijnandan vs The State of Bihar, and of the High Court of Bombay in Criminal Application No. 114 of 1950, re Jai singhbhai Ishwarlal Modi."
PRECEDENT,"The majority judgments of the Patna and the Bombay High Courts, although the impugned Acts of the State Legislatures before them were materially different on certain important points, have given clause (5) of article 19 the latter meaning. "
REASONING,"While the reasonableness of the restrictions has to be considered with regard to the exercise of the right, it does not necessarily exclude from the consideration of the Court the question of reasonableness of the procedural part of the law. "
RPC,"In my opinion, this argument is unsound. "
REASONING,"That can be done only by reading the word ""may"" for that purpose as having the meaning of ""shall"" If the word ""may"" has to be so read for that purpose, it appears to be against the well recognised canons of construction to 527 read the same ""may"" as having a different meaning when the order is to be in force for less than three months. "
REASONING,A reference to the advisory board necessarily implies a consideration of the case by such board. 
REASONING,The absence of an express statement to that effect in the impugned Act does not invalidate the Act.
RPC,"It was finally contended on behalf of the petitioner that the grounds for the externment order supplied to him are vague, insufficient and incomplete. "
RPC,"Apart from being vague, I think that these grounds are specific and if honestly believed can support the order. "
RPC,I therefore think that this contention of the petitioner must be rejected. 
RPC,I agree that this application must fail. 
RPC,MAHAJAN J. I concur in the judgment which my brother Mukherjea is delivering and for the reasons given by him I allow the petition and quash the order of externment. 
REASONING,"Such a restricted interpretation is, in my opinion, not at all warranted by the language of the sub clause."
RPC,"Thus, although I agree with the learned Attorney General that the word ""reasonable"" in clause (5) of article 19 goes with ""restrictions"" and not with ""law,"" I cannot accept his suggestion as regards the proper way of determining the reasonableness of the restrictions which a legislation might impose upon the exercise of the right of free movement. -"
REASONING,"It is not disputed that under clause (5) of article 19, the reasonableness of a challenged legislation has to be determined by a Court and the Court decides such matters by applying some objective standard which is said to be the standard of an average prudent man."
RPC,"As regards orders made by a District Magistrate, the period indeed has been fixed at three months, but even here the Provincial Government is competent to extend it to any length of time by means of a special order. "
RPC,"The law does not fix any maximum period beyond which the order cannot continue; and the fact that the Act itself would expire in August, 1951, is, in my opinion, not a relevant matter for consideration in this connection at all. "
RPC,I have no hesitation in holding that the provision of sub section (3) of section 4 is manifestly unreasonable and cannot be supported on any just ground. 
RPC,"One could understand that the exigencies of circumstances might justify the vesting of plenary powers on certain authorities which could pass orders on their ' own personal satisfaction temporarily and for a short period of time; but if these orders are to continue indefinitely, it is only fair that an opportunity should be given to the person against whom such order is made to say what he has to say in answer to the allegations made against him. "
RPC,There may not be an investigation by a regular Court but it is necessary that the aggrieved person should be given a fair hearing and that by an 535 impartial tribunal.
RPC,The grounds need not be communicated at all if the authorities so desire.
RPC,"As regards the right of representation the latter part of the sub section seems to imply that when the order is to remain in force for more than three months, the right of representation should be given to the aggrieved person and the representation shall be referred for consideration to the advisory tribunal constituted under section 3, subsection (4), of the Act. "
RPC,"The right, however, is purely illusory as would appear from the fact that even in cases where the order is to be operative for more than three months, there is no obligation on the part of the authorities to communicate to the person the grounds upon which the order was made."
RPC,"The aggrieved person consequently may not at all be apprised of the allegations made against him and it will be impossible for him to make any adequate or proper representation, if he is not told on what grounds the order was passed. "
RPC,"In my opinion, this is an equally unreasonable provision and neither sub section (3) nor sub section (6) of section 4 of the Act can be said to have imposed restrictions which are reasonable in the interests of the general public. "
RPC,"My conclusion, therefore, is that under article 13 (1) of the Indian Constitution, these provisions of the Act became void and inoperative after the Constitution came into 536 force, and consequently the order made by the District Magistrate in the present case cannot stand. "
RPC,"I would, therefore, allow the application and quash the externment order that has been passed against the petitioner."
RPC,Petition dismissed. 
FACTS,"In the first case, the charges against the appellant and the employee in charge of the pump in question therein were that they on the 27th June, 1945, at Guntur, supplied petrol to a cars without taking coupons, in contravention of clause 22 read with clause 5 of the said Order promulgated under rule 81 (2) of the Defence of India Rules and that they, on the same day and at the same place, accepted coupons relating to two other cars in advance without supplying petrol, in contravention of clause 27 of the Order."
FACTS,"This view is set out very clearly in the following passage which may be quoted from the judgment of the trial Magistrate: ""It is argued on behalf of accused 1 that he is not a resident of Guntur and that he has no knowledge of any infringement committed by accused 2."
FACTS,""" Before deciding the question as to how far mens rea is material to conviction for the offences with which the appellant is charged, it is necessary to refer to the rele vant provisions of the Defence of India Rules and the Motor Spirit Rationing Order, 1941."
PRECEDENT,The question raised in this appeal was con sidered by the Privy 327 Council in Srinivas Mall Bairolia vs King Emperor(1).
REASONING,Rule 81 (4) of the Rules provided for the punishment of persons guilty of contravening any such orders.
PRECEDENT,See the judgment of Wright J. in Sherras vs De Rutzen(1).
REASONING,"Offences which are within that class are usually of a comparatively minor character, and it would be a surprising result of this delegated legislation if a person who was morally inno cent of blame could be held vicariously liable for a serv ant 's crime and so punishable ' with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years. ' Their Lordships agree with the view which was recently expressed by the Lord Chief Justice of England, when he said: ' It is in my opinion of the utmost importance for the protection of the liberty of the subject that a court should always bear in mind that, unless the statute, either clearly or by necessary implica tion rules out mens rea as a constituent part of a crime, a defendant should not be found guilty of an offence against the criminal law unless he has got a guilty mind: Brend vs Wood(2) '"" In our opinion, the view of the law as propounded by the Privy Council is the correct view, and, applying it to the present case, it is difficult to hold the appellant guilty of the offence under clause 22 read with clause 5 of the Motor Spirit Rationing Order, 1941."
PRECEDENT,"In the course of the arguments, reference was made on behalf of the appellant to the decision of the Bombay High Court in Isak Solomon Macmull vs Emperor(1) which is a case relating to the contravention of clause 22 of the Motor Spirit Rationing Order."
PRECEDENT,"In that case, the learned Chief Justice, who delivered the judgment, referred to the well established rule that unless a statute either clearly or by necessary implication rules out mens rea as a constituent part of a crime, the defendant should not be held guilty of an offence under the criminal law unless he has a guilty mind."
REASONING,"It is conceivable that in many cases the default will be committed by the servants of the supplier, who are in charge of the petrol pump, but that fact by itself will not exonerate the suppli er from liability."
PRECEDENT,"In Mousell Brothers vs London and North Western Railway( '), Viscount Reading C.J., dealing with a case under the Railways Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, observed as follows : ""Prima facie, then, a master is not to be made criminal ly responsible for the acts of his servant to which the master is not a party."
REASONING,""" In the same case, Atkin J. expressed the same view in these words : ""I think that the authorities cited by my Lord make it plain that while prima facie a principal is not to be made criminally responsible for the acts of his servants, yet the Legislature may prohibit an act or enforce a duty in such words as to make the prohibition or the duty absolute; in which case the principal is liable if the act is in fact done by his servants."
PRECEDENT,"vs Tylor(1). ' ' In Mullins vs Collins(2), the servant of a licensed victualler having knowingly supplied liquor to a constable on duty without the authority of his superior officer, it was held that the licensed victualler was liable to be convicted although he had no knowledge of the act of his servant."
RPC,"In this view, the appeal is allowed in part, and while the conviction and sentence imposed on the (1) (3)[1895] IQB."
RPC,"(2) [1874] L.,R. 9 Q. B. 292 332 appellant on the first charge in both the cases are quashed, the conviction and sentence on the third charge in the second case are affirmed."
RPC,Appeal allowed in part.
FACTS,The material facts are these.
FACTS,"On the 26th of November, 1947, the District Magistrate cancelled his bail as the Magistrate considered that the sureties were not proper."
FACTS,"On the 6th of December, 1948, sanction was granted by the Provincial Government to prosecute the appel lant inter alia under sections 161 and 165 of of the Indian Penal Code."
REASONING,""" It therefore follows that for the Prevention of Corrup tion Act, offences under sections 161 and 165 of the Indian Penal Code become cognizable, notwithstanding what is pro vided in the Criminal Procedure Code."
PRECEDENT,"319 Learned counsel for the appellant relied on some observa tions in Emperor vs Sourindra Mohan Chuckerbutty (1), in respect of the interpretation of the word 'cognizance '."
PRECEDENT,"In Gopal Marwari vs Emperor (1), it was observed that the word 'cognizance 'is used in the Code to indicate the point when the Magistrate or a Judge first takes judicial notice of an offence."
PRECEDENT,"After referring to the observations in Emperor vs Sou rindra Mohan Chuckerbutty (2), it was stated by Das Gupta J. in Superintendent and Remembrancer of Legal Affairs, West Bengal vs Abani Kumar Banerjee (3) as follows : "" What is taking cognizance has not been defined in the Criminal Procedure Code and I have no desire to attempt to define it."
RPC,It seems to us therefore that the appellant 's conten tion that the Magistrate had to take cognizance of the offences without the previous sanction of the Government is untenable and the appeal fails.
RPC,Appeal dismissed.
FACTS,"The appellants were prosecuted for alleged offences under sections 147, 148, 323, 324, 326, 302 and 302/149 of the Indian Penal Code at the instance of one Polai Lal Biswas who lodged a complaint against them before the po lice."
FACTS,An altercation followed as a result of which Logendra or dered an assault by his men.
REASONING,Prosecution must stand on its own legs and must prove the story told by it at the very first stage.
REASONING,"The manner of occurrence alleged by the prosecution must be established beyond doubt before the accused persons can be convicted""."
REASONING,"He, therefore, disbelieved the whole story that Polai had taken the lands of his grandmother or his uncles as bataidar for cultivation and that he was engaged in harvesting the paddy crop on the lands at the time of the occurrence."
RPC,Appeal allowed.
FACTS,The shop is 673 divided into two sections.
FACTS,"On Monday, the 17th of May, 1948, the appellant 's son sold a tin of boot polish to a customer from the haberdash ery, section of the shop."
FACTS,"A certificate for leave to appeal to this Court, on the ground that a substantial question of law relating to the Govern ment of India Act, 1935, was involved, was granted and that is how we come to be seized of the matter."
REASONING,"In our opinion, the matter can come either under item No. 27 in List II or item No. 27 in List III."
REASONING,"674 Item No. 27 in List II covers ""trade and commerce within the Province."
REASONING,"Therefore, in so far as section 7 covers establish ments where labour is employed, it is undoubtedly intra vires."
REASONING,"The legislature may have felt it necessary, in order to reduce the possibilities of evasion to a minimum, to encroach upon the liberties of those who would not otherwise have been affected."
REASONING,To permit such a distinction might well engender discontent and in the end react upon the relations between employer and employed.
REASONING,All these are matters of policy into which we cannot enter but which serve to justify a wide and liberal interpretation of words and phrases in these entries.
RPC,The appeal fails and is dismissed.
RPC,Appeal dismissed.
FACTS,"This contention was disposed of by the learned Chief Justice in these words : ""Mr. Joshi seems to be right but with this qualification that the commercial asset must be at the time it was let out in a condition to be used as a commercial asset by the assessee."
PRECEDENT,"We, however, are in respectful agreement with the observations of Lord 7 President Strathclyde in Sutherland vs The Commissioners of Inland Revenue(1) that if a commercial asset is susceptible of being put to a variety of different uses in which gain might be acquired, whichever of these uses it was put to by the appellant, the profit earned was a user of the asset of the same business."
PRECEDENT,He contended that the facts of this case were analogous to the case of Inland Revenue Commissioners vs lies(2) and it should be similarly decided.
PRECEDENT,"8 Greene M.R. in Croft vs Sywell Aerodrome Ltd. (1), wherein the learned Master of the Rolls observed as fol lows: ""I cannot myself see that a person who leases the land to others, or grants licences to others to come upon it, is doing anything more than exploiting his own rights of property, even if the tenant or licensee is, by the terms of the lease or licence, entitled himself to carry on a trade on the land."
PRECEDENT,"The distinction becomes apparent from the following passage which occurs in Atkinson J. 's judgment in I les 's case(2) : ""Then it was suggested by counsel for the Crown that the case was like the Desoutter case(3), where it was held that, if you make use of a patent in your business and also receive royalties from the use of the patent by others licensed to use it, those royalties cannot be regarded as receipts from an investment."
PRECEDENT,"In other words, the door has to be either open or shut."
PRECEDENT,A patent is either an investment or it is not.
PRECEDENT,"That, however, is dead in the teeth of the judgment in the Broadway Car Co. case(4)."
PRECEDENT,"The same argument was tried there, but Tucker L.J. said he thought the Desoutter case(3) had very little to do with it, as there was a great difference between land (1) (3) (2) (4) 9 and a patent, and he did not think the Desoutter case(1) threw any light on the matter ."
REASONING,"A patent is quite different from freehold land."" These observations appositely apply to the case of a company incorporated for the purpose of doing business and earning profit by the process of manufacture."
PRECEDENT,The observations therefore made in I les 's case(2) can have no apposite application to the case of a manufacturing concern letting out a part of its machinery temporarily which it cannot advantageously use itself.
RPC,Appeal allowed.
RPC,Agent for the appellant.
FACTS,We will state the facts chronolog ically.
FACTS,"On the 7th of September, 1922, the late Maharaja died and at the time of his death his successor, the present Maharaja, was a minor."
REASONING,We are of opinion that it was not.
FACTS,"In the year 1938 there was a law which required all enactments after the 1st of November, 1924, to be published in the Gazette."
REASONING,"That Act, in addition to making provision for publication in certain official Gazettes, also provides for the 114 making of rules by Order in Council for the best means of making Proclamations known to the public."
PRECEDENT,"For example, on a somewhat lower plane, it was held in Johnson vs Sargant (1) that an Order of the Food Controller under the Beans, Peas and Pulse (Requisition) Order, 1917 does not become operative until it is made known to the public, and the difference between an Order of that kind and an Act of the British Parliament is Stressed."
REASONING,There must therefore be promulgation and publication in their cases.
PRECEDENT,"See, for example, Crown vs Manghumal Tekuml(1), Shakoor vs King Emperor (2) and Babulal vs King Emperor (3)."
REASONING,"We are enti tled therefore to import into this matter consideration of the principles and notions of natural justice which underlie the British Constitution, for it is inconceivable that a representative of His Britannic Majesty could have contem plated the creation of a body which could wield powers so abhorrent to the fundamental principles of natural justice which all freedom loving peoples share."
RPC,The appeal succeeds.
RPC,The conviction and sentence are set aside.
RPC,"The fine, if paid, will be refunded."
RPC,Appeal allowed.
FACTS,The Jullundur Wholesale Cloth Syndicate was formed to work out the distribution of cloth under the Government of Punjab Control (Cloth) Order passed under the Essential Supplies Act.
FACTS,"It was stated ,that they had been disposing of most of the stocks of cloth received for the Jullundur District in the black market at exhorbitant rates from June, 1949, to Octo ber, 1950, during the period when control on distribution was removed and that even after the reimposition of that control in October, 1950, they disposed of cloth which has been frozen under the directions of Director of Civil Sup plies in the short interval between the passing of the order and its service on them."
REASONING,It was next contended that in any event now as their licences are cancelled they cannot deal in cloth and the order of detention now maintained against them is more in the nature of punishment than prevention.
REASONING,"Proceeding on the footing, therefore, that the jurisdiction to decide whether the appellants should be detained under the on the grounds conveyed to the appellants is of the District Magistrate."
REASONING,We are unable to accept this contention.
REASONING,Moreover this order does not bring about the result claimed for it.
REASONING,"This cloth can be purchased by any wholesale dealer of cloth of India, without any restriction."
RPC,
RPC,
FACTS,"The petitioner is the printer, publisher and editor of a recently started weekly journal in English called Cross Roads printed and published in Bombay."
PRECEDENT,"He referred to Emperor vs Bisheswar Prasad Sinha (1) where such a rule of practice was enforced in a criminal revision case, and called our attention also to certain American decisions Urquhart vs Brown (2) and Hooney vs Kolohan (3) as showing that the Supreme Court of the United States ordinarily required that whatever judicial remedies remained open to the appli cant in Federal and State Courts should be exhausted before the remedy in the Supreme Court be it habeas corpus or certiorari would be allowed."
PRECEDENT,See also LoveIl vs City of Griffin(s).
REASONING,"As Stephen in his 'Criminal Law of England(1) observes: ' ' Unlawful assemblies, riots, insurrections, rebellions, levying of war, are offences which run into each other and are not capable of being marked off by perfectly defined boundaries."
PRECEDENT,"In this connection it may be recalled that the Federal Court had, in defining sedition in Niharendu Dutt Majumdar vs The King Emperor (1), held that ""the acts or words complained of must either incite to disorder or must be such as to satisfy reasonable men that that is their intention or tendency"", but the Privy Council overruled that 602 decision and emphatically reaffirmed the view expressed in Tilak 's case (1) to the effect that ""the offence ""consisted in exciting or attempting to excite in others certain bad feelings towards the Government and not in exciting or attempting to excite mutiny or rebellion, or any sort of actual disturbance, great or small "" King Emperor vs Sada shiv Narayan Bhalerao (2) Deletion of the word ""sedition"" from the draft article 13 (2), therefore, shows that criticism of Government exciting disaffection or bad feel ings towards it is not to be regarded as a justifying ground for restricting the freedom of expression and of the press, unless it is such as to undermine the security of or tend to overthrow the State."
PRECEDENT,"But the framers of the Constitution may well have reflected, with Madison who was ""the leading spirit in the preparation of the First Amendment of the Federal Constitution,"" that ""it is better to leave a few of its noxious branches to their luxuriant growth, than, by pruning them away, to injure the vigour of those yielding the proper fruits."": [Quoted in Near vs Minnesotta (3)]."
REASONING,603 restrictions which it seeks to impose may have been con ceived generally in the interests of public order.
REASONING,We are unable to accede to this contention.
RPC,"So long as the possibility of its being applied for purposes not sanctioned by the Consti tution cannot be ruled out, it must be held to be wholly unconstitutional and void."
RPC,The application is therefore allowed and the order of the respondents prohibiting the entry and circulation of the petitioner 's journal in the State of Madras is hereby quashed.
RPC,"In this view, I would dismiss this petition, but I should like to add a few observations to supplement what I have said in the other case."
RPC,"I have bor rowed the words quoted within inverted commas from the preamble of the Act which shows its scope and necessity and the question raised before us attacking the, validity of the Act must be formulated in the manner I have suggested."
RPC,"If the answer to the question is in the affirmative, as I think it must be, then the impugned law which prohibits entry into the State of Madras of ""any document or class of documents"" for securing public safety and maintenance of public order should satisfy the requirements laid down in article 19 (2)of the Constitution."
RPC,"From the trend of the arguments addressed to us, it would appear that if a docu ment is seditious, its entry could be validly prohibited, because sedition is a matter which undermines the security of the State; but if, on the other hand, the document is calculated to disturb public tranquillity and affect public safety, its entry cannot be prohibited, because public disorder and disturbance of public tranquillity are not matters which undermine the security of the State."
PRECEDENT,"In Brij Bhushan and Another vs The State(1), I have quoted good authority to show that sedition owes its gravity to its tendency to create disorders and an authority on criminal law like Sir James Stephen has classed sedition as an of fence against public tranquillity."
RPC,"If so, how could sedi tion be a matter which would undermine the security of the State and public disorders and disturbance of public safety will not be such a matter? It was argued that a small riot or an affray will not (1) ; 605 undermine the security of the State, but to this line of argument there is a two fold answer : (1) The Act, as its preamble shows, is not intended for petty disorders but for disorders involving menace to the peace and tranquillity of the Province, (2) There are de grees of gravity in the offence of sedition also and an isolated piece of writing of mildly seditious character by one insignificant individual may not also, from the layman 's point of view, be a matter which undermines the security of the State, but that would not affect the law which aims at checking sedition."
RPC,"It was also said that the law as it stands may be misused by the State executive, but misuse of the law is one thing and its being unconstitutional is another."
RPC,We are here concerned with the latter aspect only.
RPC,Petition allowed.
FACTS,The plain tiffs state that the two branches of the family were sepa rate at all material times; that on 480 Shanker Lal 's death in 1884 his daughter Mst.
FACTS,Mohan Dei possessed into two categories.
FACTS,"First, there was property which they say be longed to her."
FACTS,"These are properties which, according to them, she purchased or obtained under mortgages in her own right."
FACTS,"Next, there were properties which belonged exclu sively to her father and to which she succeeded as daughter."
RPC,"In our opinion, the defendants are right."
FACTS,Even if the award be invalid we are of opinion that the plaintiffs ' claim is completely answered by the plea of estoppel.
FACTS,"Mohan Dei to act greatly to her detriment and to alter her position by accepting the award and parting with an appreciable portion of the estate, and he himself obtained a substantial advantage to which he would not otherwise have been entitled and enjoyed the benefit of it for the rest of his life; and to his credit be it said, he never attempted to go behind his decision."
PRECEDENT,"There also there was a dispute between a limited owner and a person who, but for an un proved claim (adoption) which he (1) (1919) 45 I.A. 118."
PRECEDENT,"485 put forward, had no right to the estate."
PRECEDENT,"Later, the succession opened out and the other party to the compromise, who by then had stepped into the reversion, claimed the rest of the estate, which had been assigned to the limited owner, against her personal heirs."
PRECEDENT,"The Judicial Committee rejected the claim on the ground of estoppel and held that even though the plaintiff claimed in a different character in the suit, namely as reversioner, he having been a party to the compro mise and having acted on it and induced the other side to alter her position to her detriment, was estopped."
FACTS,"Even if the arbitrator was wholly wrong and even if he had no power to decide as he did, it was open to both sides to accept the decision and by their acceptance recognise the existence of facts which would in law give the other an absolute estate in the properties they agreed to divide among themselves and did divide."
FACTS,Brijlal 's sons therefore had no more right to that portion of his estate which was assigned to Brijlal than Brijlal himself.
FACTS,"But apart from this, there was also an independent estoppel in Kishan Lal."
FACTS,"She dealt with it on that footing and gifted it in that right to her grand sons, the contesting defendants, on 4th April, 1929."
FACTS,"Mohan Dei died, that is, for a further forty years, and led Mst."
REASONING,"The documents filed show it was after, so there is no reason why the main portion of his statement which is uncontradicted, and which could have been contradicted, should not be accepted."
PRECEDENT,"The decision of the Judicial Committee which we have just cited, Kanhai Lal vs Brijlal(1), is, we think, clear on that point."
PRECEDENT,Although other reversioners who do not claim through the one who has consented are not bound.
PRECEDENT,the consenting reversioner is estopped.
PRECEDENT,This is beyond dispute when there is an alienation by a limited owner without legal necessity.
PRECEDENT,"See Ramgouda Annagouda vs Bhausaheb (2) where the ground of decision was "". .but"
PRECEDENT,Annagouda himself being a party to and benefiting by the transaction evidenced thereby was preclud ed from questioning any part of it.
PRECEDENT,""" In our opinion, the same principles apply to a case of the present kind."
PRECEDENT,"It was contended, however, on the strength of Rangasami Gounden vs Nachiappa Gounden(3) and Mr. Binda Kuer vs Lalitha Prasad(4), that even if Kishan Lal did take posses sion in 1889or 1890 on the strength of a title derived from his father, that would not have precluded him from asserting his own rights in a different character when the succession opened (1)(1918) 45 I.A 118."
PRECEDENT,(3) (1919) 46 I.A. 72.
PRECEDENT,(4) (1936) A.I.R. 1936 P.C. 304 at 308.
PRECEDENT,489 out.
PRECEDENT,Reliance in particular was placed upon page 808 of the latter ruling.
RPC,"In our opinion, that decision is to be distinguished."
PRECEDENT,In that case the reversion did not fall in till 1916.
PRECEDENT,"Long before that, namely in 1868, the next presumptive reversioners entered into a compromise whereby the grandfa ther of one Jairam who figured in that case obtained a good deal more than he Would have been entitled to in the ordi nary way."
PRECEDENT,"But for the compromise this grandfather would have got only one anna 12 gundas share, whereas due to the compromise he got as much as 2 annas 4 gundas, The actual taking of possession was however deferred under the compro mise till the death of one Anandi Kuer."
PRECEDENT,She died in 1885 and on that date Jairam was entitled to his grandfather 's share as both his father and grandfather were dead.
PRECEDENT,Jairam accordingly reaped the benefit of the transaction.
PRECEDENT,Jairam lost 1 anna 4 gundas to a creditor Munniram and out of the one anna which he had left from the 2 annas 4 gundas he sold 13 gundas to the plaintiffs for a sum of Rs. 500.
PRECEDENT,Now it is evident that on those facts it is impossible to predicate that the 13 gundas which the plaintiffs pur chased came out of the extra 12 gundas which Jairam obtained because of the compromise rather than out of the 1 anna 12 gundas to which he had a good and independent title anyway; and of course unless the plaintiffs ' 13 gundas could be assigned with certainty to the 12 gundas it would be impos sible to say that they had obtained any benefit from the compromise.
PRECEDENT,The Judicial Committee also added that even if it was possible to assign this 13 gundas with certainty to the 12 gundas it by no means followed that the plaintiffs admitted that fact nor would that necessarily have given them a benefit under the compromise.
PRECEDENT,They had the right to contest 'the 490 position and gamble on the possibility of being able to prove the contrary.
PRECEDENT,"Their Lordships added "" Unless the plaintiffs ' individual conduct makes it unjust that they should have a place among Bajrangi Lal 's reversioners their legal rights should have effect."
PRECEDENT,""" In the other case, Rangasami Gounden vs Nachiappa Goun den(1), their Lordships ' decision about this matter turned on the same sort of point: see page 87."
PRECEDENT,The present case is very different.
PRECEDENT,"When Kishan Lal took possession of his father 's property he held by virtue of the award and under no other title, and for forty years he continued to derive benefit from it."
PRECEDENT,"It was conceded that if the estoppel against Kishan Lal enured after October 1929, then the plaintiffs, who claim through Kishan Lal, would also be estopped."
RPC,The appeal succeeds.
RPC,The decree of the High Court is set aside and that of the first Court dismissing the plaintiffs ' claim is restored.
RPC,Costs here and in the High Court will be borne by the plaintiffs respondents.
RPC,Appeal allowed.
FACTS,At that date Andheri did not form a part of Bombay and under the.
FACTS,"One of the grounds given was that ""The Government of Bombay are giving very careful atten tion and affording all reasonable facilities to develop the Greater Bombay into a model one."
FACTS,"A modern cinema, there fore, of the type I propose to build is indispensable."
FACTS,""" In view of that, not unnaturally, the Commissioner of Police appears to have consulted the Government of Bombay, for he wrote to the respondent on the 25th of April, 1946, saying that ""the whole question of considering and approving sites for cinemas is under the consideration of the Government of Bombay,"" and he promised that ""when a decision is arrived at, your application will be examined."
FACTS,"Five members of this Committee appear to have inspected the site on the 12th of May, 1947, and after prolonged discussion they reached the conclusion that ""in view of the location of four schools near by the site, this site is unsuitable for the purpose required and therefore it should be rejected."
FACTS,""" A note was drawn up to that effect and the matter was ordered to be placed on the agenda of the next meeting of the Committee ""for final decision."" This final decision has not been placed on record but the Commissioner of Police tells us in his affidavit that within a month the Committee advised that the application should be granted."
FACTS,"Accordingly, the Commissioner accorded the necessary permission by his 139 letter dated the 14/16th of July, 1947."
FACTS,There is no refer ence here to the recommendations of the Advisory co Commit tee and.
REASONING,Then comes the letter in question which conveys those orders.
REASONING,"They are framed under section 22 (1) (f) (i) (g) and (h) of the City of Bombay Police Act, 1902."
REASONING,"Rule 23S prescribes that : ""No such premises shall be opened, or kept open for use as a place of public amusement unless the person being the owner, tenant or occupier thereof shall have obtained from the Commissioner the necessary license."
REASONING,It is clear to us from a perusal of these rules that the only person vested with authority to grant or refuse a license for the erection of a building to be used for pur poses of public amusement is the Commissioner of Police.
REASONING,He merely forwarded to the respondent an order of cancellation which another authority had pur ported to pass.
REASONING,It is evident from these facts that the Commissioner had before him objections which called for the exercise of the discretion regarding cancellation specifi cally vested in him by Rule 250.
REASONING,It was objected as to this that there is no specific law which compels him to exercise the discretion.
PRECEDENT,"That is easily met by the observations of Earl Cairns L.C. in the House of Lords in Julius vs Lord Bishop of Oxford(i), observations which have our full and respect ful concurrence : ""There may be something in the nature of the thing empowered to be done, something in the object for which it is to be done, something in the conditions under which it is to be done, something in the title of the person or persons for whose benefit the power is to be exercised, which may couple the power with a duty, and make it the duty of the person in whom the power is reposed, to exercise that power when called upon to do so."
REASONING,""" The discretion vested in the Commissioner of Police under Rule 250 has been conferred upon him for public rea sons involving the convenience, safety, (1) 5 App."
REASONING,"214 at 222, 223."
REASONING,"We can see no reason why statutory duties should be placed on any different plane from other duties enjoined by any other kind of law, especially as some."
REASONING,statutory duties are slight or trivial when compared to certain other kinds of duties which are not referable to a statutory provision.
REASONING,In our opinion.
REASONING,"In a commer cial undertaking of the kind we have here, inordinate delay might well spell ruin to the project."
REASONING,"Lastly, it was urged that the petition is incompetent because the provisions of section 46 of the Specific Relief Act have not been complied with, namely, the petitioner has not shown that he made a demand for justice and that it was denied."
REASONING,"In our opinion, there was a substantial demand here and it is clear that there was a denial."
REASONING,"It is true the actual demand was not made to the Commissioner nor was the denial by him but he clearly washed his hands of the matter by his letter of the 3rd/4th December, 1947, and referred the petitioner to Government under whose orders he said he was acting."
REASONING,The demand made to Government and the denial by them were therefore in substance a demand made to the Commission er and a denial by him.
RPC,"The following will accordingly be substituted for what the High Court has ordered: The Commissioner of Police be directed to consider the requests made to him for cancellation of the license sanc tioned by his letter dated the 14/16th of July, 1947, and, after weighing all the different aspects of the matter, and after bringing to bear his own unlettered judgment on the subject, himself to issue a definite and unambiguous order either canceling or refusing to cancel the said license in the exercise of the absolute discretion vested in him by Rule 250 of the Rules for Licensing and Controlling Theaters and Other Places of Public Amusement in Bombay City, 1914."
RPC,"As the appeal fails except for the slight modification indicated above, the appellant will pay the respondent 's costs."
RPC,Decree modified.
FACTS,"The suit was decreed by the trial court and the decision was affirmed, on appeal, by the District Judge, Purulia, and on Second Ap peal, by a Division Bench of the High Court of Patna."
FACTS,"There might have been, according to the learned Counsel, two tenancies for one year each for two successive periods, but on the expiry of the second yearly lease, which happened on 7th December, 1926, the defendant ceased to be a tenant and no fresh tenancy was created by holding over as is contemplated by section 116 of the Transfer of Property Act."
FACTS,"The claim was based substantially upon the terms of the Kabuliyat executed by the defendant on 24th of December, 1924, and the suit was, in fact, one for ejectment of a lessee on the expiration of the period provided for in the lease."
FACTS,36 274 The defendant in his written statement resisted the plaintiff 's claim for possession primarily on the ground that he had acquired permanent rights in the land under the Prodhan 's Patta of 1913 and continuous occupation of it since then for more than 12 years.
FACTS,The trial judge decreed the suit.
FACTS,"This judgment of the High Court was pro nounced on the 5th of May, 1942."
FACTS,"Soon after this on 18th July, 1942, the plaintiff served a notice to quit on the defendant, asking him to vacate the land on the 7th of August following, and as the defendant refused to give up possession, the present suit was brought on 22nd July, 1943."
FACTS,"The plaintiff avers that by reason of the payment of rent on 8th March, 1925, and 16th March, 1926 the defendant became a tenant from month to month under him and the tenan cy was determined by a proper notice to quit."
FACTS,On these pleadings a number of issues were framed.
FACTS,"The first point, the District Judge pointed out, was contrary to the express decisions of the Patna High Court, while the second was contradictory to the defendant 's own admission in the written statement."
REASONING,"Conse quently, when the rent reserved is an annual rent, the presumption would arise that the tenancy was an annual tenancy unless there is something to rebut the presumption."
PRECEDENT,"We are not unmindful of the fact that in (1) Vide Debendra Nath vs Syama Prasanna, , 1126 37 282 certain reported cases, such inference has been drawn."
PRECEDENT,"One such case has been referred to by Mr.Justice Reuben in his judgment(1), where reliance was placed upon an earlier decision of the Calcutta High CoUrt(3)."
REASONING,"It is one thing to say that in the absence of a valid agreement, the rights of the parties would be regulat ed by law in the same manner as if no agreement existed at all; it is quite another thing to substitute a new agreement for the parties which is palpably contradicted by the admit ted facts of the case."
PRECEDENT,(2) Md. Moosa vs Jaganund (3) 17 C.L.J. 167.
REASONING,"We think, therefore, that on the facts of this case it would be quite proper to hold that the tenancy of the defendant was one from month to month since its inception in 1924."
RPC,The appeal thus fails and is dismissed with costs.
RPC,Appeal dismissed.
FACTS,"The question involved in the appeal relates to the right of succession to six Birbhum ghatwalis governed by Regulation XXIX of 1814, annexed to Gaddi Pathrol and lying within Tappasarath in the Santhal Parganas."
FACTS,"On the 29th November, 1935, the 155 Commissioner of Bhagalpur Division recognized Smt."
FACTS,"It was common ground between the parties that in case the properties were held to be the separate properties of Kali Prasad Singh, the widow was entitled to succeed to them."
REASONING,"In our opinion, the main point that needs decision is whether the suit ghatwalis were to be regarded as joint family or separate properties of the deceased."
PRECEDENT,"In Harlal Singh vs Joravan Singh(1), it was held that a ghatwali estate in Birbhum was not divisible (1) 6 Select."
REASONING,"It was said that ghatwali lands are grants for particular pur poses, especially of police, and to divide them into small portions amongst the heirs of the ghatwals would defeat the very ends for which the grants were made."
PRECEDENT,"In Satrukchunder Dey vs Bhagat Bharutchunder Singh(1), a decision of the year 1853, it was stated that the ghatwali tenures in Birbhum were not private property of the ghatwals but lands assigned by the State in remuneration for specific police services and were not alienable or attachable for personal debts."
PRECEDENT,"Kustooree Koomaree vs Monohur Deo(2), Loch J. took the view that succession to ghatwalis is regulated by no rule of kulachar or family custom, nor by the Mitakshara law, but solely by the nature of the ghatwali tenure, which descends undivided to the party who succeeds to and holds the tenure as ghatwal and that a female is not incapable of holding a ghatwali tenure."
PRECEDENT,"It was said that ""the party who succeeds to and holds the tenure as ghatwal must be, and has always been, looked upon as sole proprietor thereof, and, therefore, the other members of the family cannot claim to be coparceners and entitled to share in the profits of the property, though they may, by the permission and goodwill of the incumbent, derive their support, either from some portion of the property which he may have assigned to them, or directly from himself."" In Binode Ram Sein vs Deputy Commissioner of Santhai Pargangs(3), (on review it was held that the rents of a ghatwali tenure are not liable for the debts of the former deceased holder of the tenure."
PRECEDENT,The reason for the decision was that the tenure was held for the purpose of public services and those who perform the services are entitled to the whole of the remuneration.
PRECEDENT,"159 In Tekait Durga Pershad Singh vs Teketnee Durga Kuari(1), it was urged that a female 's right to inherit was inconsistent with a ghatwali estate."
PRECEDENT,"This case further sug gests that in a case where it is held proved that the family was joint, succession to Birbhum ghatwali may be regulated by the same rule of Hindu law as is applicable to the devo lution of impartible estates."
PRECEDENT,"In Ram Narain Singh vs Ramoon Paurey(2), another Birbhum ghatwali case, it was held that the ghatwal for the time being was only entitled to interest on the compensation money obtained for compulsory acquisition of a part of the ghatwali interest but that he could not spend the corpus of it which had to devolve on the next heir intact."
PRECEDENT,"So far as Birbhum ghatwalis are concerned, it is only the above mentioned cases to which our attention was drawn."
PRECEDENT,"As observed in Katama Natchir vs The Raja of Sivaganga(1), there has to be community of interest and unity of posses sion between all the, members of the family, and upon the death of any one of them the others may well take by survi vorship that in which they had during the deceased 's life time a common interest and a common possession."
PRECEDENT,The inci dents attaching to a Birbhum ghatwali tenure rule out the existence of any notion of community of interest and unity of possession of the members of the family with the holder for the time being.
PRECEDENT,He is entitled to be maintained in exclusive possession of the ghatwali lands and the devolu tion of the property is to him in the status of a sole heir.
PRECEDENT,"His Lordship observed as follows : ""Where, however, the Mitakshara governs, each son imme diately on his birth takes a share equal to his father in the ancestral immoveable estate."
PRECEDENT,"Having regard to the origin and nature of ghatwali tenures and their purposes and inci dents as established by decided cases, most of which have been referred to in the course of the argument, it is admit ted that such a tenure is in some particulars distinct from, and cannot be governed by, either the general objects of Hindu inheritance as above stated, or by the before quoted rule of the Mitakshara."
PRECEDENT,"It is admitted that a ghatwali estate is impartable that is to say, not subject to partition; that the eldest son succeeds to the whole to the exclusion of his brothers."
PRECEDENT,These are propositions that seem to exclude the application of the Mitakshara rule that the sons on birth each take an equal estate with the father and are entitled to partition.
PRECEDENT,""" Similar opinion was expressed in Chhalraclhari Singh vs Saraswati Kumari(3), by a Bench of the (1) (1861 3) 9 M.I.A. 543."
REASONING,"The learned counsel for the appellant in support of his contention placed reliance on a number of decisions of their Lordships of the Privy Council concerning impartible estates governed by the Mitakshara law, wherein it was held that the succession to an impartible estate which is the ancestral property of a joint Hindu family governed by the Mitakshara law is governed by the rule of survivorship subject to the custom of impartibility; the eldest member of the senior branch of the family succeeding in preference to the direct lineal senior descendants of the common ancestor, if the latter is more remote in degree."
PRECEDENT,"Particular reference was made to the remarks of Turner L. I. in the Sivaganga case(1), and to the observations in Baijnath Prasad Singh vs Tej Bali Singh (2) and in the case of Shiba Prasad Singh vs Rani Prayag Kumari Debi(3)."
REASONING,But the right of survivor ship is not inconsistent with the custom of impartibility.
REASONING,"In our view, these observations have no application to the tenures in suit."
REASONING,This reasoning can have no application to property which at no stage what ever could be clothed or was clothed with any of the inci dents of coparcenary property.
PRECEDENT,"He drew our attention to the observations made in Sartaj Kuari 's case(1), in the Second Pittapur case(2), and in Tipperah case(3)."
PRECEDENT,"There may be a seeming conflict between the view expressed in those decisions and the view expressed in Baijnath Prasad Singh vs Tej Bali Singh(4), and in Shiba Prasad Singh vs Rani Prayag Kurnari Debi(5)."
REASONING,"The appellant 's counsel conceded that if the property was the separate property of Kali Prasad Singh, the defendant was entitled to inherit to it."
PRECEDENT,On this point we are in agreement with the observations made by a Bench of the Calcutta High Court in Chhatradhari Singh vs Saraswyati Kumari(1).
REASONING,"It may further be pointed out that even if the conten tion of the learned counsel for the appellant is to be accepted, by no process could the trial court have passed a decree in favour of the plaintiff in respect of items 4, 5 and 6 of the schedule Admittedly these were acquired by Krishna Prasad Singh, father of Kali Prasad Singh by a decree of court passed in his favour against his collateral Katku Singh who also claimed these properties as an heir to the last male owner Banwari Singh (vide Exhibit 4)."
REASONING,"This allegation was controverted in the written statement, and it was claimed that the family was governed by the Mitakshara system of law and ""there was no clan custom governing the estate in suit."
REASONING,"171 The trial judge however found that in four of these in stances the nearest agnate who claimed the property was separate from the ghatwal or his widow, but, in the other instances, there was no evidence of separation, or ""the evidence was weak"", which, I take it, is another way of saying that it could not be safely relied on."
REASONING,""" In my opinion, whatever evidence there is in this case supports the Commissioner 's view, and there is hardly any cogent evidence to rebut it."
RPC,"In the circumstances, I agree that this appeal ought to be dis missed with costs."
RPC,Appeal dismissed.
FACTS,"These are five companion appeals from the judgment of the High Court at Orissa, delivered on five petitions filed by the respondent in each of the appeals, to obtain from the Court a writ of mandamus and/or directions under article 226 of 'the Constitution of India."
FACTS,Each of the respondents alleged that between 1941 and 1947 he had agreed to take from the Ruler of Keonjhar a mining lease and had entered into possession of the area.
FACTS,"On the 14th December, 1947, the Ruler of Keonjhar entered into a merger agreement with the Dominion of India and as from the 1st January, 1948, the State was merged in the Dominion of India."
FACTS,"The Bench therefore passed an order dated 2nd August, 1951, as follows : ""We direct that till three months from today or one week after the institution of their (respondents ') contemplated suit, whichever is earlier, the Government of the State of Orissa should refrain from disturbing the petitioners ' possession over the mining areas in question and that thereafter this order will cease to have effect."
FACTS,"He stated that although he was reluctant to exercise the powers under article 226 because the present respondents could file a suit, yet as in view of section 80 of the Civil Procedure Code there would be an unavoidable delay resulting in irreparable loss to the respondents he agreed that the order should be passed as mentioned in the judgment of the Chief Justice, 32 Towards the end of his judgment he stated as follows: ""It should however be clearly emphasized that the observations contained in this judgment should not be taken as pre judg ing any question which may.arise for the consideration of the Civil Court in the event of the petitioners filing a regular suit and seeking interim relief from that Court by way of temporary injunction, appointment of receiver or otherwise."
FACTS,""" It appears that thereafter an application was made to stay the operation of this order to enable the Government of Orissa to appeal against the order of the 2nd of August."
REASONING,(2) The power conferred on a High Court by clause (1) shall not be in derogation of the power conferred on the Supreme Court by clause (2) of article The language of the Article shows that the issuing of writs or directions by the Court is not rounded only on its decision that a right of the aggrieved party under Part II1 of the Constitution (Fundamental Rights) has been in fringed.
REASONING,"It must be noted that with the passing of the order of the 2nd August, 1951, containing directions in the nature of interim relief the petitions were completely disposed of and have not been kept pending for disposal."
RPC,"In our opinion, the language of article 226 does not permit such an action."
RPC,On that short ground the judgment of the Orissa High Court under appeal cannot be upheld.
RPC,Appeals allowed.
FACTS,"The suit was brought initially against one defendant, name ly, the Court of Wards, Satara, and admittedly the Court of Wards took possession of the property of Bhimabai, while she was alive, and is continuing in possession of the same even now after her death."
FACTS,"Later on, defendants 2, 3 and 4, who put forward rival claims of succession to the estate, were allowed to intervene in the suit and were added as parties defendants."
FACTS,their claims in the appeal before us.
FACTS,In 1896 Vithalrao died and he was succeeded by his eldest son Ganpatrao under the law of primogeniture.
FACTS,"Nilkanthrao left behind him one son named Firangojirao and two daughters, while Anandrao died childless, leaving him surviving his widow Krishnabai, who later on adopted Vithalrao, who is defendant No. 4 in the suit."
FACTS,"Ganpatrao had left a will bequeathing all his watan and nonwatan properties to Firangojirao and the latter succeeded to the estate both under the will as well as under the law of lineal promogeniture, he being the only male member of the family at that time."
FACTS,"As said al ready, the defendant No. 4, who is respondent No. 2 in this appeal, was added as a party defendant sometime after the suit was filed and the contention raised on his behalf was that by reason of his having been duly adopted."
FACTS,"to Anandrao on 4th of November, 1924, he was the nearest heir to the property in suit which was a watan property and prayed that a declaration in his favour might be made by the court."
REASONING,The learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the plain tiffs appellants has raised a two fold contention in support of the appeal.
REASONING,"Viramitrodaya adds to this that ""on failure of mother and father it goes to their (1) See Mitakshara, Chap."
REASONING,"Whether this distinction between male and female propositus is at all reasonable is another matter, but the language of the Act makes this distinction expressly and so long as the language is clear and unambiguous, no other consideration is at all relevant."
REASONING,150); Kuppuswami v Manickasari (A.I.R. (2) Shamrao vs Raghunandan (I.L.R. ; Mst.
REASONING,442); Indra Pal vs Humangi Debi (I.L.R. 1949 All. 816).
RPC,The appeal will thus stand dismissed.
RPC,"We make no order as to costs in this appeal except that defendant No. 1, the Court of Wards, would have its costs as between attorney and client out of the estate."
RPC,The order for costs made by the courts below will stand.
RPC,Appeal dismissed.
FACTS,"Lastly, he is said to have fired at Kartar Singh, son of Bishan Singh and one Jangir Singh, while they were raising an alarm, but the bullet missed them."
REASONING,""" It should be noted 375 that that section is only one of the exceptions to the general rule laid down in section 233 of the Code that for every distinct offence, there shall be a separate charge and every such charge shall be tried separately."
PRECEDENT,"There are several reported cases in which a similar view has been taken, and in our opinion they have not been incorrectly decided."
PRECEDENT,"In Queen Empress vs Raghu Rai(1), where a person stole several bullocks from the same herdsman at the same time, it was held that only one offence had been committed."
PRECEDENT,"In Promotha Nath Ray vs King Emperor(2), it was held that misappropria tion in regard to several account books constituted only one offence."
PRECEDENT,"In Johan Subarna vs King EmPeror(3), it was held that when an attempt to cheat a number of men by speaking to them in a body had been committed, one joint charge was valid."
PRECEDENT,"In Poonit Singh vs Madho Bhot (4), it was held that only one offence had been committed by a person who gave false information in one statement to the police against 2 persons."
PRECEDENT,"In Sudheendrakumar Ray vs Emperor(5), a person who was chased by 2 constables had fired at them several times, but it seems to have been rightly assumed that the firing did not constitute more than one offence, though the point was not specifically raised or decided."
RPC,Appeal dismissed.
FACTS,The High Court later granted leave to appeal under article 134 (1)(c) of the Constitution as the case involved questions of law of general importance.
FACTS,He did not certify that the child understood the duty of speaking the truth.
PRECEDENT,"Their Lordships stated in Mohamed Sugal Esa vs The King(1) : (1) A.I.R. 1946 P.C. 3 at 5 382 ""Section 13, Oaths Act, is quite unqualified in its terms and there is nothing to suggest that it is to apply only where the omission to administer the oath occurs per incuriam."
PRECEDENT,""" The decisions to which their Lordships refer are and Ram Samujh vs Emperor(2)."
REASONING,"The principle of the decisions ap plies here because, as their Lordships observe, the section is unqualified in its terms."
REASONING,One can presume that the learned Judge had that in mind from the fact that he exam ined the child after referring to a fact which arises out of the proviso.
REASONING,""" Now a woman who has been raped is not an accomplice."
PRECEDENT,Bishram.
PRECEDENT,"On the other hand, the Privy Council has said in Mohamed Sugal Esa vs The King(2) that as a matter of prudence a conviction should not ordinarily be based on the uncorroborated evidence of a child witness."
PRECEDENT,"In my opinion, the true rule is that in every case of this type the rule about the advisability of corroboration should be present to the mind of the judge."
PRECEDENT,In a jury case he must tell the (1) A.I.R. 1944 Nag. 363.
PRECEDENT,(2) A.I.R. 1946 P.C. 3 at 5.
REASONING,""" Secondly, the independent evidence must not only make it safe to believe that the crime was committed but must in some way reasonably connect or tend to connect the accused with it by confirming in some material particular the testi mony of the accomplice or complainant that the accused committed the crime."
REASONING,"Were it otherwise, ""many crimes which are usually committed between accomplices in secret, such as incest, offences with females"" (or unnatural offences) ""could never be brought to justice."" Next, I turn to another aspect of the case."
REASONING,She says that when she went home she lay down and went to sleep and that when her mother returned she asked her why she was sleeping and then she told her mother what had happened.
REASONING,"So far as this case is con cerned, I have no doubt on that score."
REASONING,It is true the ac cused suggested that they were on bad terms but that has not been believed by anyone.
RPC,I agree.
RPC,Appeal dismissed.
FACTS,"The appellants thereafter applied to the Privy Council for special leave, which was granted on the 28th October, 1947."
FACTS,"At that point of time, Behari Singh and 10 to 15 persons came and fight took place between the parties."
FACTS,"Three other persons, Zorawar, Rajpal and Lakhan also received gun shot injuries."
FACTS,"After hearing the evidence in the case, the Ses sions Judge delivered judgment on the 20th February, 1946."
REASONING,"Hari Singh had received 7 injuries including a grievous injury, and Nikka Singh also was injured, his injury having been noticed by the investigating sub inspec tor."
REASONING,"It is well established that in an appeal under section 417 of the Criminal Procedure Code, the High Court has full power to review the evidence upon which the order of acquit tal was founded, but it is equally well settled that the presumption of innocence of the accused is further rein forced by his acquittal by the trial court, and the findings of the trial court which had the advantage of seeing the witnesses and hearing their evidence can be reversed only for very substantial and compelling reasons."
RPC,"In the result, we allow the appeal, set aside the con viction and sentences of the appellants and acquit them of all the charges."
RPC,Appeal allowed.
FACTS,"This is a petition under article 32 of the Constitution for the enforcement of the petition er 's fundamental rights under article 19 (1) (f) and article 31(1) alleged to have been violated by the Central Bank of India Ltd., a company incorporated under the Indian Compa nies Act, 1882, and having its registered office at Bombay, (hereinafter referred to as ""the Bank"")."
REASONING,"Article 31 (1) itself contemplates a law being passed authorising deprivation of the properties, and it is futile to deny the existence of the requisite legislative power."
RPC,The petition is dismissed.
RPC,We make no order as to costs.
RPC,Petition dismissed.
FACTS,It is contended that the law in force in the State authorizing it to prohib it the manufacture of bidis in certain villages including the one 761 wherein the applicants reside is inconsistent with the provisions of Part III of the Constitution and is conse quently void.
FACTS,"The Central Provinces and Berar Regulation of Manufac ture of Bidis (Agricultural Purposes) Act, LXIV of 1948, was passed on 19th October 1948 and was the law in force in the State at the commencement of the Constitution."
REASONING,"In other words, a manufacturer of bidis residing in this area cannot import labour from neighbouring places in the district or province or from outside the province."
RPC,We are therefore of opinion 98 766 that the impugned statute does not stand the test of reason ableness and is therefore void.
RPC,"The result therefore is that the orders issued by the Deputy Commissioner on 13th June 1950 and 26th September 1950 are void, inoperative and ineffective."
RPC,We therefore direct the respondents not to enforce the provisions con tained in section 4 of the Act against the petitioners in any manner whatsoever.
RPC,The petitioners will have their costs of these proceedings in the two petitions.
RPC,Petitions allowed.
FACTS,The appellant was one of the persons who had filed nomination papers for election to the Madras Legislative Assembly from the Namakkal Constituency in Salem district.
FACTS,The appellant thereupon moved the High Court under article 226 of the Constitution praying for a writ of of certiorari to quash the order of the Re turning Officer rejecting his nomination paper and to direct the Returning Officer to include his name in the list of valid nominations to be published.
FACTS,"Broadly speaking, the arguments on which the judgment of the High Court is assailed are two fold : (1) that the conclusion arrived at by the High Court does not follow from the language of article 329 (b) of the Constitution, whether that article is read by itself or along with the other articles in Part XV of the Constitu tion; and (2) that the anomalies which will arise if the construc tion put by the High Court on article 329 (b) is accepted, are so startling that the courts should lean in favour of the construction put forward on behalf of the appellant."
PRECEDENT,""" These observations however represent only one side of the picture and the same learned Judge presented the other side of the picture in a subsequent case [Desi Chettiar vs Chinnasami Chettiar(2)] in the following passage : ""The petitioner is not without his remedy."
PRECEDENT,His remedy lies in an election petition which we understand he has already put in.
PRECEDENT,It is argued for him (1) mad. 585 at 600.
REASONING,"Now, the main controversy in this appeal centres round the meaning of the words ""no election shall be called in question except by an election petition"" in article 329 (b), and the point to be decided is whether questioning the action of the Returning Officer in rejecting a nomination paper can be said to be comprehended within the words, ""no election shall be called in question."
REASONING,"It is a question of fact in each case when an election begins in such a way as to make the parties concerned responsible for breaches of election law, the test being whether the contest is ""reason ably imminent""."
REASONING,The election will usually begin at least earlier than the issue of the writ.
REASONING,"The next important question to be considered is what is meant by the words ""no election shall be called in ques tion""."
REASONING,"They 30 230 are : (1) prohibition against discrimination in the prepa ration of, or eligibility for inclusion in, the electoral rolls, on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or any of them; and (2) adult suffrage."
REASONING,Part XV of the Constitution is really a code in itself providing the entire ground work for enacting appropriate laws and setting up suitable ma chinery for the conduct of elections.
REASONING,"Part VI deals with disputes regarding elections and provides for the manner of presentation of election peti tions, the constitution of election tribunals and the trial of election petitions."
REASONING,I think that those words are quite apt to exclude the jurisdiction of the High Court to deal with any matter which may arise while the elections are in progress.
REASONING,"The same scheme was followed in the election rules framed under the Government of India Act, 1935, which are contained in ""The Government of India (Provincial Elections) (Corrupt Practices and Election Petitions) Order, 1936"", dated the 3rd July, 1936."
REASONING,239 And now a word as to why negative language was used in article 829 (b).
REASONING,Under section 36 of the Representation.
RPC,The appeal must therefore fail and is dismissed.
RPC,"In view of the nature and importance of the points raised in this appeal, there should be no order to costs."

FACTS,This is an appeal against the judgment of the High Court at Calcutta upholding the order of the Ses sions Judge of Midnapore convicting the appellant under section 326 of the Indian Penal Code and sentencing him to 3 years ' rigorous imprisonment.
FACTS,"The police being informed, started investigation and submitted a charge sheet against the appellant who was finally committed to the Court of Sessions and tried by the Sessions Judge and a jury."
FACTS,"He was charged under section 307 of the Indian Penal Code, but the jury returned a verdict of guilty against him under section 326 of the Penal Code, and the learned Sessions Judge accepting the verdict convicted him under that section as aforesaid."
PRECEDENT,"In Begu vs The King Emperor (1) the Privy Council had to deal with a case where certain persons were charged under section 302 of the Penal Code, but were convicted under section 201 for causing the disappearance of evidence."
PRECEDENT,Their Lordships entertain no doubt that the procedure was a proper procedure and one warranted by the Code of Criminal Procedure.
REASONING,"These arguments however have very little force, since there is no evidence to show that those persons had seen the occurrence, an d they also do not take note of the fact that such evidence as has been adduced by the prosecution, if believed, was suffi cient to support the conviction of the appellant."
REASONING,It appears that three questions ware put to the appellant by the Sessions Judge after the conclusion of the prosecution evidence.
RPC,The appeal accordingly fails and is dismissed.
RPC,Appeal dismissed.
FACTS,"It Was further alleged that the endorse ment made by accused 1 (Nargundkar) in the said letter ""No action seems necessary."
FACTS,"File"", and marked to Superintendent ""S"" was not made on the 21st November, 1946, which date it bears."
FACTS,"Exhibit P 27 bears date 31st October, 1946."
FACTS,"Nargundkar in the note sheet, Exhibit P 27, in the month of July or August, 1947."
FACTS,The dates were antedated.
FACTS,"This note sheet was not prepared on gist October, 1946."
FACTS,"Whether he was telling the truth, or he was telling a lie, as appears likely from his cross examination, he is in either event, not a person on whom any reliance could be placed."
REASONING,The trial magistrate was of the opinion that friendship between the two accused was of a very rapid growth and that their relations were very intimate and accused 2 was in a position to influence accused 1.
REASONING,If there were no variations whatsoever between those tenders that would have defeated the very purpose of submitting them.
REASONING,"Even in the subsequent quotations except in one case where the disparity in the tales of Doongaji and Patel is only two pies, the disparity in the rates is from 9 to 11 pies."
REASONING,If he had seen the tender of Doongaji he would have modelled the rates in a manner that would give him the highest profit.
REASONING,The trial magis trate as well as the Sessions Judge ignored all these dif ferences in the method of the description of the appendices and assumed that they had been uniformly described.
REASONING,"As soon as I went there, all of them were astonished and they could not speak with me for a moment, and then they carried on some dry general conversation with me."
REASONING,"I am bringing these incidents to your notice, as I fear that something underhand may not be going on, and I am afraid that my tender may be tampered with."
REASONING,"In his statement under section 342, Cr. P.C., Patel said that he saw Amarnath on the morning of the 15th or 16th November, 1946, and he met Amarnath at Seoni at the distillery prem ises on the 16th November, 1946, and on the same 1108 day he met him at about 9 p.m. at the Seoni dak bungalow and that he again met him on the 17th November, at 10 a.m."
REASONING,A.M. Naidu below his signature has written '6 4 1948 '.
REASONING,""" We have looked in vain for other evidence to prove that the letter was not written on 'the date it bears."
REASONING,"The accused Patel, when questioned about this letter, made the following statement: ""Exhibit P 31 was typed on the office typewriter article B. Exhibit P 24 being my personal complaint letter was typed by my Personal Assistant on one of the typewriters which were brought in the same office for trial, with a view to purchase."
REASONING,An admission must be used either as a whole or not at all.
RPC,Appellants acquitted.
RPC,Agent for the appellant in Criminal Appeal No. 56 of 1951: Ganpat Rai.
RPC,Agent for the appellant in Criminal Appeal No. S7 of 1951: Rajinder Narain.
FACTS,"On August 10, 1908, the said receiver with the permis sion of the Court which had appointed him as receiver grant ed two mining leases, each for 999 years one in respect of 5/16 share of the Malias in Mouza Monohar Bahal and the other in respect of 230 bighas in village Marich Kota to a firm then carrying on business under the name and style of Laik Banerjee & Company."
FACTS,As a result of these transactions the firm of Laik Banerjee & Company became the lessees for 999 years of the two properties as well as the mortgagee of the lessors ' interest in the same.
FACTS,"A large sum remaining still due to Deva Prasanna, he applied for, and on October 30, 1935, obtained a personal decree for Rs. 1,27,179 0 6 against Raja Pramatha Nath Malia who had by inheritance acquired the lessors ' interest and become the borrower."
FACTS,30th January 1937.
FACTS,"The Bengal Money Lend ers Act, 1940 (Bengal Act X of 1940) hereinafter called the Act, came into force on September 1, 1940."
FACTS,The suit was filed by the appellants against the respondent under section 36 of the Act praying for reopening the trans actions and taking accounts and for release from all liabil ities in excess of the limits specified by law.
FACTS,There was also a prayer for reconveyance of the Senapati Mahal.
FACTS,The respondent filed his written statement setting up a variety of defences rounded on merits as well as on legal pleas in bar.
REASONING,"There are, however, two provisions to sub section (1) of section 36."
PRECEDENT,"In the light of the decision of the Full Bench of the 581 Calcutta High Court in Mrityunjay Mitra vs Satis Chandra Banerji(1) which was approved by the Privy Council in Jadu Nath Roy vs Kshitish Chandra Acharyya(2), it has not been contended, in view of the fact that the personal decree for the balance remained unsatisfied on January 1, 1939, that the decrees in Suit No. 78 of 1922 were fully satisfied within the meaning of the above proviso."
PRECEDENT,"Therefore, the only thing that remains to be ascertained is whether the decrees were passed in ""a suit to which this Act applies."
PRECEDENT,"In this Act, unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context"" (22) ""Suit to which this Act applies ""means any suit or proceeding instituted or filed on or after the 1st day of January, 1939, or pending on that date and includes a pro ceeding in execution (a) for the recovery of a loan advanced before or after the commencement of this Act; (b) for the enforcement of any agreement entered into before or after the commencement of this Act, whether by way of settlement of account or otherwise, or of any security so taken, in respect of any loan advanced whether before or after the commencement of this Act; or (c) for the redemption of any security given before or after the commencement of this Act in respect of any loan advanced whether before or after the commencement of this Act."
PRECEDENT,""" The words ""instituted or filed on or after the 1st day of January, 1939, or pending on that date"" have been read and understood as qualifying the words ""any suit or proceed ing"" in the beginning of the definition as well as the words ""proceeding in execution"" occurring further down: see per Spens C.J. in Bank of ' Commerce Ltd. vs Amulya Krishna (3)."
PRECEDENT,"Accordingly, it has (1) I.L.R. 11944) 2Cal. 376; (2) L.R. 76 I.A. 179 at p. 190."
PRECEDENT,(3) ;A.I.R. 1944 F.C. 18.
PRECEDENT,"582 been held in Ram Kumar De vs Abhoya Pada Bhattacharjee (1) that where a decree is such that the suit in which it was passed had terminated before January 1, 1939, and no pro ceeding in execution was started or was actually pending on or after that date it is not a decree in ""a suit to which this Act applies""and cannot be reopened."
PRECEDENT,The same view was upheld by a Special Bench of the Calcutta High Court in Aparna Kumari vs Girish Chandra (2)which overruled two earlier decisions to the contrary.
REASONING,"Order XXI, rule 57, is expressed in the following terms : ""Where any property has been attached in execution of a decree but by reason of the decree holder 's default the Court is unable to proceed further with the application for execution, it shall either dismiss the application or for any sufficient reason adjourn the proceedings to a future date."
PRECEDENT,The reason why rule 57 was introduced in the Code of 1908 has been explained by Rank in C.J. in Shibnath Singh Ray vs Sheikh Saberuddin Ahmad(3) as follows: (1) ; (2) (3) I.L.R. at pp.
REASONING,It may (1) adjourn the proceedings for good reason which will automatically keep the attachment alive or (2) simply dismiss the application which will automatically destroy the attachment or (3) dismiss the application but specifically keep alive the attachment by an express order.
REASONING,"The continuance of the attachment, in the circumstances, needs no execution proceeding to support it."
PRECEDENT,See Raja Shri Prakash Singh vs The Allahabad Bank Ltd. (1).
PRECEDENT,"In In re Clagett 's Estate; Fordham vs Clagett (1) Jessel M.R. declared that ""a pending matter in any court of justice means one in which some proceeding may still be taken""."
REASONING,There is no question here but that the submortgage to the respondent 's predecessor in title was bona fide.
REASONING,Nor could he have received the notice referred to in clause (a) of ' sub section (1) of section 28 as the transaction took place long before the Act was passed.
PRECEDENT,"The only question, therefore, is whether the respondent as sub mortgagee is an assignee within the meaning of sub section (5) of section 36."
PRECEDENT,"The learned (1) (2) L.R. 72 I.A. 156, 591 Judges in the court below held that he was not, following an earlier decision of their own court in Promode Kumar Roy vs Nikhil Bhusan Mukhopadhya(1)."
PRECEDENT,"That decision, however, was reversed by the Privy Council in Promode Kumar Roy vs Nikhil Bhusan Mukhopadhya(2) where their Lordships dealt with the question now before us in the following terms : ""It was suggested, in the judgment of Mitter J. (with which Waight J. agreed), and in the argument for the re spondents that if a sub mortgagee were an `assignee ' within section 36, sub section (5), of the Act."
REASONING,", certain difficul ties and anomalies would result."
REASONING,"The decision referred to above is, therefore, directly in point and rules the present case."
PRECEDENT,It was suggested that the said decision was inconsist ent with the earlier decisions of the same tribunal in Ram Kinkar Banerjee vs Satya Charan Srimani(1) and Jagadamba Loan Co. vs Raja Shiba Prasad Singh(2).
REASONING,This is a rather super ficial view of the matter.
PRECEDENT,"These cases had no bearing on the question, which arose in Promode Kumar Roy vs Nikhil Bhusan Mukhopadhya (1) and arises in the present case, as to whether a sub mortga gee becomes an assignee of the mortgage debt and of the mortgagee 's right to recover the debt from the original mortgagor."
PRECEDENT,"It was from this point of view that the question as to the nature of the right transferred to a sub mortgagee under his sub mortgage was considered in Promode Kumar Roy vs Nikhil Bhusan Mukho padhya(1) as it has to be considered in the present case, and the reference to the sub mortgage containing an assign ment of all the rights (1) 76 I,A. 74."
RPC,In the result I agree that the appeal fails and should be dismissed with costs.
RPC,Appeal dismissed.
FACTS,"The delivery was to be made every month from January, 1951, at the rate of 1,00,000 yards per month under 864 each of these notes and payments were to be made in cash 'on delivery, each delivery being treated as a separate and distinct contract."
FACTS,"The Bought Notes commenced thus: Dear Sirs, We have this day Bought by your order and on your account from our Principals."
FACTS,"The appellant required from the respondent delivery of goods in respect of the month of March but the latter informed the appellant, by a letter dated the 27th March, 1951, that its principals disowned a liability in this respect as there was default on the part of the appellant in not giving shipping instructions for the said goods within the time mentioned in the contracts."
FACTS,"It was alleged in the plaint that the plaintiff acted merely as broker and in that capacity brought about the two contracts of sale and purchase evidenced by the two Bought Notes mentioned above, that the real seller was a firm known as Gowarchand Danchand, and that the plaintiff not being a party to the contract could not incur any liability under its terms."
REASONING,In substance therefore the controversy between the parties in the suit is whether the plaintiff did incur any liability in terms of the contracts evidenced by the two Bought Notes to which it was a signatory no matter in whatever capacity.
PRECEDENT,"But as Lord Porter pointed out in Heyman vs Darwins (2), ""this does not mean that in every instance (1) Vide per Viscount Simon in Heyman vs Darwins, at 360."
PRECEDENT,"(2) , 393."
PRECEDENT,869 in which it is claimed that the arbitrator has no juris diction the Court will refuse to stay an action.
PRECEDENT,"The observations quoted above were approved of by Mr. Justice section R. Das in the case of Khusiram V. Hanutmal (1) and it was held by the learned Judge that where on an application made under section 34 of the for stay of a suit, an issue is raised as to the formation, existence or validity of the con."
PRECEDENT,870 Company vs Gordhandass (1).
RPC,"If the Court is of opinion that the respondent was in fact a party, the suit shall be stayed and the appellant would be allowed to, proceed by way of arbitration in accordance with the arbitration clause."
RPC,"If on the other hand the finding is adverse to the appellant, the application will be dismissed."
RPC,The appellant will have its costs of this appeal.
RPC,Further costs between the parties will abide the result.
RPC,Appeal allowed.
FACTS,For convenience I will call this the suit mortgage though this is not a suit on the mortgage.
FACTS,It was directed that the consid eration should first be applied in payment of the claim and costs and that the decreeholder should execute a reconvey ance of the rest of the mortgaged properties in favour of the mortgagors.
FACTS,"These sums came out of the rents which the Receiver obtained from the plaintiff 's property, 20 Round Tank Lane."
FACTS,Gyarsi 's claim and in connection with the reconveyance.
FACTS,"In addition to this the plaintiff asked for (1) ""a declaration that the properties mentioned in Schedule 'A '. belonging to the defendants stand charged with the repayment of the sum of Rs. 80,507 7 8 being the aggregate amount due and payable by the two defendants,"" and (2) ""Decree under Order XXXIV of the Civil Procedure Code in proper form."" Schedule A contains a list of the rest of the mortgaged properties which belong exclusively to the defendants, 24 182 It will be seen that the plaintiff claims on the basis that each of the three mortgagors is liable to contribute in equal shares towards payment of the mortgage debt."
FACTS,The defendants did not deny their liability to contribute.
FACTS,"The amount which went towards satisfaction of the defendant 's portion of these earlier liabilities was only Rs. 13,259 2 4."
REASONING,The mortgagee was Binode Behari Sen.
REASONING,"In that event B would pay A Rs. 5,000 and C would pay Rs. 5,000."
REASONING,"In that event B 's share would be 3/10 of Rs. 15,000, that is to say, Rs. 4,500."
REASONING,But we are dealing here with a mortgage and so we have also to look to the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act.
REASONING,The first confers a right of contribution.
PRECEDENT,The Privy Council pointed out in Rani Chhatra Kumari vs Mohan Bikram (1) that the doctrine of the (1) Pat. 851 at 869.
PRECEDENT,187 equitable estate has no application in India.
PRECEDENT,"So also refer ring to the right of redemption their Lordships held in Mohammad Sher Khan vs Seth Swami Dayal(1) that the right is now governed by statute, namely section 60, Transfer of Property Act."
PRECEDENT,Sulaiman c.
REASONING,", On the facts set out by the plaintiff it is evident that he is entitled to contribution."
REASONING,"He also tells us that the parties regarded the matter as confidential and so only three per sons were present, Tarak, Naku and himself."
REASONING,"It is to be observed that Naku, who is the second defendant, has not entered the box."
PRECEDENT,The law regarding this was examined by me at some length in the Nagpur High Court in Shamjibhai vs Jagoo Hernchand Shah (1).
REASONING,"It is evident that he, at any rate, was not prepared to leave matters as they were and trust to the good faith of his brothers."
PRECEDENT,I do not doubt the soundness of the rule but it can be pushed too far as their Lordships of the Judicial Committee pointed out in Virappa vs Periakaruppan(1).
REASONING,"In the present case, the learned Judge who tried the case believed Kedar not because of his demea nour but because the learned Judge considered that his story was inherently probable."
REASONING,"The plaintiff repudiated section 82 in the course of the arguments before us and rested his case on section 43 of the Contract Act, nor did he clearly and unmistakably plead a case of subrogation in his plaint even in the alternative."
RPC,FAZL ALI J.
RPC,I agree.
RPC,Case remanded.
FACTS,"in exercise of the powers conferred by sub section (1) of section 3 and section 4 of the Preven tive Detention Act, 1950, as amended by the Preventive Detention (Amendment) Act, 1951, the Governor of Punjab hereby directs that the said Naranjan Singh Nathawan be committed to the custody of the Inspector General of Pris ons, Punjab, and detained in any jail of the State till 31st March, 1952, subject to such conditions as to maintenance, discipline and punishment for breaches of discipline as have been specified by general order or as contained in the Punjab Detenu Rules, 1950."
FACTS,"revoking the order of detention dated 17th May, 1951, and on the same date the District Magistrate, Amritsar, issued yet another order for the detention of the petitioner under sections a and 4 of the amended Act; this last order along with the grounds on which it was based was served on the petitioner on 19th November, 1951."
FACTS,"In view of this, the Government decided that the cases of all dete nus should be reviewed by the District Magistrates con cerned."
FACTS,""" The original and supplementary petitions came on in due course for hearing before Fazl Ali and Vivian Bose JJ."
PRECEDENT,"on 17th December, 1951, when reliance was placed on behalf of t he petitioner on certain observations in an unreported decision of this Court in Petition No. 334 of 1951 (Naranjan Singh vs The State of Punjab) and it was claimed that in view of those observations and of the provisions of Part III of the Constitution, the decision in Basant Chandra Ghose vs King Emperor(1), on which the respondent relied."
REASONING,"It was urged that article 22 lays down the procedure to be followed in cases of preventive detention and the said procedure must be strictly observed 401 as the only prospect of release by a court must be on the basis of technical or formal defects, a long line of deci sions having held that the scope of judicial review in matters of preventive detention is practically limited to an enquiry as to whether there has been strict compliance with the requirements of the law."
PRECEDENT,"This is undoubtedly true and this Court had occasion in the recent case of Makhan Singh Tarsikka vs The State of Punjab (Petition No. 308 of 1951)(1) to observe ""it cannot too often be emphasised that before a person is deprived of his personal liberty the procedure established by law must be strictly followed and must not be departed from to the disadvantage of the person affected""."
REASONING,"The learned Judges appear to have inferred from the facts of that case that the later order was (1) Since reported as ; 402 not made bona fide on being satisfied that the petitioner 's detention was still necessary but it was ""obviously to defeat the present petition""."
RPC,We accordingly remit the case for further hearing.
RPC,This order will govern the other petitions where the same ques tion was raised.
RPC,Petitions remitted.
FACTS,"On the 28th of March, 1940, the mortgagee assigned them both to the plaintiff who now sues on them."
FACTS,"The Court appointing him required him to produce a surety in the sum of Rs. 10,000."
FACTS,And only for that reason I am executing this agreement and giving it to you in writing and thereunder I am settling and formulating some new terms and I am confirming some very terms which were declared before.
FACTS,Clause (5) reduces this to 8 annas.
PRECEDENT,"We agree with the learned Rangoon Judges in U. Po Thin vs Official Assignee(1) that one part of the ""interest"" which a mortga gee has in mortgaged property is the right to receive inter est at a certain rate when the document provides for inter est."
REASONING,"There, the mortgagors gave the mortgagees an unregistered rukka or written promise simulta neously with the registered mortgage stipulating that they would pay an extra 6 per cent per annum over and above the 15 per cent entered in the mortgage."
REASONING,(1) (1938) R.L.R. 293: A.I.R. 1938 R. 285.
PRECEDENT,"496 It was argued, on the strength of Mahim Chandra Dey vs Ram Dayal Dutta,(1) Ram Ranjan vs Jayanti lal(2) and Collec tor of Etah vs Kishori Lal(3), that it is always open to a mortgagee to release or remit a part of the debt, and when he does so he does not limit or extinguish an interest in immovable property any more than when he passes a receipt acknowledging payment of the whole or part of the money."
REASONING,"The effect of the payment, or of the release, may be to extin guish the mortgage but in themselves they do not limit the interest."
REASONING,It was argued that this brings the matter within section 17(2) (v) of the Registration Act because it gives the defendant the right to obtain another document which will effect the extinguish ment.
REASONING,"(The stress is on the words ""itself"" and ""merely "". ) We agree with Sir Dinsha Mulla at page 86 of the 5th edition of his Indian Registration Act that ""If the document itself creates an interest in immove able property, the fact that it contemplates the execution of another document will not exempt it from registration under this clause."
REASONING,"Consequently, the document is not one which merely confers a right to obtain another document."
REASONING,The next question is whether the document can be used in evidence under the proviso to section 49 of the Registration Act.
RPC,The appeal fails and is dismissed with costs.
RPC,Appeal dismissed.
FACTS,The only question is whether the suit is barred by section 4 (a) of Bombay Act X of 1876 (Bombay Revenue Juris diction Act).
FACTS,"When they arrived on the scene they decided, as far as possible, to continue such Saranjams, jagirs and inams as had been grant ed by the earlier rulers, and accordingly they framed rules under Schedule B, Rule 10 of Bombay Act XI of 1852 (The Bombay Rent Free Estates Act of 1852) to regulate the mode of recognition and the succession and conditions of tenure to Saranjams, which are analogous to jagirs."
FACTS,"In compliance with this, the common ancestor shown at the head of the genealogical tree set out above was recognised by the Brit ish Government as the Saranjamdar of the Gajendragad estate."
FACTS,In the year 1866 Bhujangrao I and his brother Yesh wantrao alias Annasaheb sued Malojirao for possession of this Saranjam.
FACTS,Bhujangrao I died in 1881 and his younger brother Yesh wantrao (alias Annasaheb) claimed to succeed as the sole heir.
FACTS,(2) Malojirao who had already taken his share of the estate was to continue in possession.
FACTS,(3) Yeshwantrao (alias Annasaheb) was given the option of remaining joint with the adopted boy or separating.
FACTS,"Finally, the Resolution Concluded 407 ``The two brothers will hold their respective shares as their private property in virtue of the decree of the High Court and the Jahagir will henceforth be restricted to the portion awarded by the High Court to Bhujangrao which the adopted son will now inherit."
FACTS,""" 53 408 In the year 1901 the adopted son Daulatrao II sued Yeshwantrao 's son Bhujangrao II for partition."
FACTS,He ordered the entries to be made accordingly.
FACTS,No Saranjam shall be capable of sub division.
FACTS,Provision for the members of the Saranjam dar 's family entitled to maintenance shall then be made by Government out of the revenues of the Saranjam so resumed.
FACTS,""" After the District Deputy Collector 's orders were passed on the 20th of May, 1930, Daulatrao II died on the 8th of May, 1931, and the matter was again taken up by Government."
FACTS,411 This was done.
FACTS,"413 (b) That in consequence of his position of a sole Saran jamdar the plaintiff alone at any rate during his lifetime has the sole right to the rights and privileges appertaining to the post of a sole Saranjamdar, to wit, to be consulted in the appointment of the village officers in all the villages appertaining to the Saranjam estate, but assigned to defendants 1 and 2 for potgi. (c) Defendants 1 and 2 be restrained from doing any acts or taking any steps in contravention of the aforesaid right of the plaintiff."
FACTS,"In any event, Mr. Somayya was asked whether he would strike out the third defendant 414 and those portions of the plaint which sought relief against it."
REASONING,It is impossible to contend that this is not a claim relating to lands held as Saranjam.
REASONING,"One of those rights, as we have seen from Rules VII and IX, is to take the revenues of the entire estate in order that he might fulfil his obligation regarding the payment of maintenance to certain members of the family; and if the defendants claim to hold their lands under the orders of Government and the plaintiff insists on retaining Government as a party in order that it may be bound by the decree he wants against the other defendants it is obvious that his claim against these defendants cannot be separated from his claim against the Government."
PRECEDENT,Basalingappagouda vs The Secretary of State for India(1) was a Watan case.
REASONING,Plaintiff sued Government and the second defendant and sought a declaration and injunction.
PRECEDENT,""" In the other case, Basangauda vs The Secretary State(1), Beaumont C.J. and Baker J. took the same view."
PRECEDENT,"It was next contended, on the strength of a decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council reported in Province of Bombay vs Horrnusji Manekji(2)."
REASONING,""" (1) (2) 74 I A. 103 417 As pointed out by Strangman K.C., on behalf of the plaintiff respondent, ""authorised"" must mean ""duly autho rised,"" and in that particular case the impugned assessment would not be duly authorised if the Government Resolution of 11 4 1990 purporting to treat the agreement relied on by the respondent as cancelled and authorising the levy of the full assessment was ultra vires under section 211 of the Land Revenue Code."
REASONING,""" That is to say, even if the Government 's act in relation to such lands was ultra vires, a claim impugning the validity of such an act would fall within the scope of the exclusion in clause (a) provided it relates to such land."
PRECEDENT,""" Dattatraya Vishwanath vs The Secretary of State for India(1) is typical of that view."
PRECEDENT,"On the other hand, Daulatrao vs Government of bombay(2), a case relating to the Gajendragad estate, took the other view."
RPC,"In my opin ion, the latter view is correct."
RPC,"In my opinion, the decision of the High Court was right and I would dismiss the appeal with costs."
RPC,PATANJALI SASTRI C.J. I agree.
RPC,S.R. DAS J. I agree.
RPC,Appeal dismissed.
FACTS,"Meanwhile, Gurnam Singh had also reached the spot and he fired with his rifle from a distance of about 4 or 5 feet near about Dalip Singh 's ear while he was lying sideways."
FACTS,"A gun shot wound 1/2""X 3/4"" on the right side of chest in the mid axillary line."
FACTS,"A gun shot wound 3/4""X 1/2"" on the front of the right arm."
FACTS,"The gun and the empty cartridges were thereupon sent to Dr. Goyle, Director of the C.I.D. Laboratory, Phillaur, and the opinion that he submitted may be summed up as follows : The gun had signs of having been fired but he could not say when it was fired last."
FACTS,"A notable feature of the case is that the occurrence is said to have taken place in the vicinity of a Gurdwara and some houses, but in spite of this fact, not a single person of the locality has been cited or examined as a witness by the prosecution."
FACTS,"Harnam Singh admittedly lives at a considerable distance from the place of occurrence but has stated that he was coming from another village where he had gone to fetch some medicine for his maternal cousin, when he 826 saw the occurrence."
FACTS,"Harnam Singh admitted in his evidence that there was a dispute between him and Mohinder Singh nearly a month before the occurrence about a wall, but he also says that the dispute ' had been amicably settled by the panchayat""."
FACTS,There is nothing before us to show what the award of the panchayat was and whether or not it left any ill feeling behind.
FACTS,He further stated in his evidence that he had passed orders on that application on the 28th February but he did not know Mohinder Singh and therefore could not say who had produced that application before him on that date.
FACTS,exhibit D C.
FACTS,"He has stated that 827 Mohinder Singh himself was present in the court of the Naib Tehsildar on the 28th February, 1949, that he had signed the application (exhibit D C) and that he was also one of the persons who had appeared before the Tehsildar when Bachittar Singh 's case was called out."
REASONING,"It is 829 elementary that where the prosecution has a definite or positive case, it must prove the whole of that case."
PRECEDENT,"This Court, as was pointed out in Pritam Singh vs The State (1), will not entertain a criminal appeal except in special and exceptional cases where it is manifest that by a disregard of the forms of legal process or by a violation of the principles of natural justice or otherwise substantial and grave injustice has been done."
REASONING,"It seems to us that the present case comes within the rule laid down, because the appellant has been convicted notwithstand ing the fact that the evidence is wanting on a most.material part of the prosecution case."
REASONING,Along with P.B. and P.C. the Parvana P.S. was also received by me.
RPC,"In our opinion, there has been in substance no fair and proper trial in this case, and we are constrained to allow this appeal, set aside the conviction of the appellant under sections 302 and 307 read with section S4 833 of the Indian Penal Code, and direct that he be set at liberty forthwith."
RPC,"In ordinary circumstances, we might have remanded the case for a flesh trial, but we consider that such a course would, in the present case, be unfair and contrary to settled practice, seeing that the appellant has been in a state of suspense over his sentence of death for more than a year."
RPC,Appeal allowed.
FACTS,The vegetable and fruit growers used to bring their goods to the town and get them auctioned through any of the vegetable dealers of their choice who used to charge one anna in the rupee as and by way of commission.
FACTS,"The respondent Committee has by auction given the contract for sale of 575 vegetables and fruits and for collecting the commission for the current year to the respondent Bishamber who, it is alleged, has never dealt in vegetables and fruits The respondent Committee has not set up any market nor has it framed any bye laws for issue of licences to the vegetable and fruit merchants."
FACTS,"The respond ents have entered appearance and filed an affidavit in opposition to the present application affirmed by their agent on record Paragraph 4 of that affidavit is as follows : ""4."
FACTS,"Paragraphs 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the petition are wrong and misleading and do not convey the correct idea."
FACTS,"Instead of getting the pay, he gets the profits, if any, and runs the risk of incurring losses if his gross realisations are less than what he paid."
FACTS,"The wholesale dealers, who will have to pay the prescribed fee to the contractor appointed by auction, will necessarily have to charge the growers of vegetables and fruits something over and above the prescribed lee so as to keep a margin of profit for themselves but in such circumstances no grower of vegetables and fruits will have his produce sold to or auctioned by the wholesale dealers at a higher rate of commission but all of them will flock to the contractor who will only charge them the prescribed commission."
REASONING,He goes further and urges that the respondent Committee has no legal authority to impose this fee of one anna in the rupee on the value of goods sold or auctioned and that such imposition is in the nature of a sale tax rather than a licence fee.
PRECEDENT,"He contends, on the authority of the decision of this Court in Ramjilal vs Income tax Officer, Mohindargarh(1), that while an ille gal imposition of tax may be challenged in a properly con stituted suit, it cannot be questioned by an application under article 32."
REASONING,"Learned counsel for the respondent Commit tee, however, urges that the growers of vegetables and fruits come on foot or in carts or on horses along the public street and stand outside the petitioner 's shop and for such use of the public street the respondent Committee is well within its powers to charge the fees."
RPC,The proper order would be to direct the respondent Committee not to prohibit the petitioner from carrying on the busi ness of a wholesale dealer in vegetables and fruits within the limits of the Jalalabad Town Area Committee until proper and valid bye laws are framed and thereafter except in accordance with a licence to be obtained by the petitioner under the bye laws to be so framed.
RPC,The respondent Commit tee will pay the costs of this application to the petition er.
FACTS,"This appeal arises as the result of special leave to appeal granted by this Court on the 1st of May, 1951, against an order of the Madras High Court dated 13th April, 1951, quashing certain proceedings of the Regional Transport Authority, Tanjore, and the Cen tral Traffic Board, Madras, dated 19th January, 1950, and 3rd March, 585 1950, respectively, and an order of the first respondent (the State of Madras) dated 7th November, 1950, and direct ing the issue to Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd., (Petitioners before the High Court) of permits for the five buses in respect of which a joint application had been made original ly by them and one T.D. Balasubramania Pillai."
FACTS,"The buses were agreed to be purchased from him by Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd., and there was a joint application by the transferor and trans feree on 10th March, 1944, for transfer of the ownership and of the 'C ' permits in the name of the purchasers."
FACTS,"Yet another move in the game was this Veerappa Pillai filed a suit in the court of the Subordinate Judge, Kumbako nam, on 3rd October, 1944, for recovery of possession of the original five buses from Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd., on the strength of his purchase from Balasubramania Pillai."
FACTS,"The suit was decreed in 587 his favour on 2nd May, 1946."
FACTS,Government consider it undesirable to keep these buses running on temporary permits for a long and indefinite period.
FACTS,""" The High Court reversed the decree of the Sub Court on 2nd September, 1949, and came to the conclusion that the title of Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd., to the five buses prevailed over that of Veerappa Pillai."
FACTS,"In their application to the Regional 'Fransport Authority dated 28th November, 1949, Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd., asked for withdrawal of the permits."
FACTS,"M.D.O. 1357, 20, 1366, 1110, 1077, M.D.O. 1368 and M.S.C.7632, which had been substituted for the disputed buses as they had become unroadworthy and useless."
FACTS,"This procedure was followed and on 22nd October, 1949, a notification was issued inviting objections against the renewal and giving 30th November, 1949, as the date of hearing."
FACTS,Till then Sri Veerappa Pillai will be given temporary permits so as not to dislocate public traf fic.
FACTS,"Thereupon, Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd., moved the High Court on 4th December, 1950, under article 226 of the Constitution in Civil Miscellaneous Petition No. 12215 of 1950 for a writ of certiorari for quashing the orders and the proceedings of the 590 Regional Transport Authority, the Central Road Traffic Board, Madras, and the State of Madras dated 19th January, 1950, 3rd March, 1950, and 7th November, 1950, respectively, and for the issue of a writ of mandamus or other such appro priate directions to the first respondent to transfer, issue or grant ""the five pucca permits in respect of the route Kumbakonam to Karaikkal to the petitioner herein"" (Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd.) It is on this petition that 'the order challenged in this appeal was made by the High Court."
RPC,"The order of the Central Road Traffic Board was in his opinion most unsatis factory, as it was based on a quibbling distinction between ""withdrawal"" and ""cancellation"" of the permits."
RPC,"In his view, the orders complained against deprived Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd., of the fruits of the 591 decree obtained by them at the hands of the High Court after much expenditure of time and money."
REASONING,"As ownership is not a condition precedent for the grant of permits and as a person can get a permit provided he is in possession of a vehicle which satisfies the requirements of the statute or the rules framed thereunder, we have to hold that the parties and the authorities were labouring under a misconception if they entertained a contrary view."
REASONING,"After Balasubramania Pillai, it was Veerappa Pillai who was running the buses continuously on this route for nearly 5 years and he also obtained the privilege of securing the permanent permits."
REASONING,"According to him, there was manifest injustice to his client in allowing them to do so and this was the reason which impelled the High Court to make the order which is the subject matter of challenge in this appeal."
REASONING,"597 For the reasons given above, the appeal is allowed and the order of the High Court set aside."
RPC,Each party will bear their own costs of these proceedings throughout.
RPC,Appeal allowed.
FACTS,"The other three respondents, through their counsel, tendered unqualified apology to the court and the learned Judges considered that no further action against them was necessary."
REASONING,"This con tention, though somewhat plausible at first sight, does not appear to us to be sound."
PRECEDENT,"The only authority which Mr. Sinha could cite in support of his contention is the decision of the Nagpur High Court in Kisan Krishna Ji vs Nagpur Conference of Society of St. Vincent de Paul("")."
PRECEDENT,"It is to be noticed that the learned Judge, who decided this case, himself took the opposite view in the case of Subordinate Judge, First Class, Hoshangabad vs Jawaharlal(6) and definitely held that the prohibition contained in section 2(3) of the Contempt of Courts Act refers to offences punishable as contempt of court by the Indian Penal Code and not to offences punishable otherwise than as contempt."
PRECEDENT,"This decision was neither noticed nor dissented from in the subsequent case, and it is quite possible that (1) Narayan Chandra vs Panehu Pramanik (A.I.R. ; Naresh Kumar.v."
PRECEDENT,Umaromar (A.I.R. 1951 Cal.
PRECEDENT,(2)Kaulashia vs Emperor (12 Pat. 1).
PRECEDENT,(3) State vs Brahma Prakash (A.I.R. 1950 All. 556); Emperor vs Jagannath (A.I.R. 1938 All. 358).
PRECEDENT,(6) A.I.R. 1940 Nag.
PRECEDENT,We think further that the decision of the Calcutta High Court in V.M. Bason vs A. H. Skone(1) which was the basis of the decision of the learned Judge in the subsequent case does not really support the view taken in it.
REASONING,We do not think that this contention can be accepted as sound.
PRECEDENT,"As the Privy Council observed in Surendra Nath Banerjee vs The Chief Justice and Judges of the High Court,(1) ""although contempt may include defamation, yet an offence of contempt is something more than mere defamation and is of a different character."
PRECEDENT,(2) Willmot 's Opinions page 256; Rex vs Davies 30 at p. 40 41. 434 What is made punishable in the Indian Penal Code is the offence of defamation as defamation and not as.
REASONING,"What is more, he did not express any regret for what he had done either in the High Court or before us and his behaviour does not show the least trace of contrition."
RPC,"In these circumstances, we think that the appeal cannot succeed and must be dismissed."
RPC,Appeal dismissed.
FACTS,Kuberdas received money and lands from his followers and disciples and with this fund he built a temple at Sarsa.
FACTS,"The Mahants after Narayandas were Baldevdas, Bhagwandas and Pragdasji, who is the defendant in the suit and each one of them was appointed by a will executed by his predecessor."
FACTS,"The defendant, it is alleged, had been acting in a manner contrary to the usages of the institution and was guilty of incontinence, mismanagement and improper alienation of trust properties."
REASONING,"the suit properties was so restricted by the obligation to maintain the institu tion for purposes which only could be described as public charitable purposes, that the suit must be regarded as one coming within section 92, Civil Procedure Code."
REASONING,"The judgment of the High Court is dated 24th of January, 1938."
RPC,The order for costs made by the courts below will stand.
RPC,Each party will bear his own costs in this appeal.
FACTS,Most of the facts are not in dispute.
FACTS,"Police Constable Bharat Singh, P.W. 17, who made the First Information Re port, said that most of the shopkeepers in Zanda Bazar are Sindhis."
FACTS,"From this place he went on to Subash Chowk, the locality in which the appellant 's shop is situate."
FACTS,Each shop opens out on to a road.
REASONING,""" In our opinion, the appellant did not use more force than was necessary."
RPC,We have confined our attention to the right of private defence of the person though in this case the question about the defence of property happens to be bound up with it.
RPC,The appeal is allowed.
RPC,The convictions and sentences are set aside and the appellant will be released.
FACTS,"68 to 74 were filed in September, 1904, by Maharaja Bahadur Singh in the court of the differ ent Munsifs at Rampurhat, against Raja Ranjit Singh Bahadur, deceased, and others, for a declaration of his title to the lands mentioned in the different suits and for mesne profits from the year 1899 till recovery of possession."
FACTS,"It was alleged that the lands in the several suits were chowkidari chakran lands within the plaintiff 's patnidari, granted to his predecessors in interest on 14th November, 1853, by the ancestors of the defendant, that as the lands were in the possession of village watchmen on service tenures, they were excluded from assessment of land revenue and no rent was paid on them, that in the year 1899 under the provisions of sections 50 and 51 of Bengal Act VI of 1870 Government resumed the lands, terminated the service tenures and settled them with the zamindar, that in this situation the plaintiff as patnidar became entitled to their actual physi cal possession, that the zamindar wrongfully took physical possession of them and denied the right of the plaintiff and hence he was entitled to the reliefs claimed."
FACTS,"The plaintiff actually obtained possession of the lands involved in these suits in August, 1913."
REASONING,It is the duty of the court to take notice of the subsequent events in order to do justice between the parties .
REASONING,""" Against the judgment and decrees of the District Judge the plaintiff preferred appeals to the High Court at Calcut ta."
REASONING,"Against the remand order appeals were preferred to the High Court and the High Court decreed the appeals in these terms : ""We set aside the portion of the decision of the Dis trict Judge which remands the cases to the original court to determine the conditions under which the patnidar is to hold the lands under the zamindar."
REASONING,"On the 28th May, 1927, another application was filed by the zamindar claiming deduction by way of equitable set off of the amounts due to him for rent from 1910 onwards and on account of subsequent payment made by him towards revenue and cesses."
REASONING,""" Against this decision special appeals were preferred to the High Court and by the judgment under appeal the decision of the trial court was restored."
REASONING,"As regards the amounts due to the appellant by way of rent subsequent to the date of transfer of possession, the claim is unconnected with the subjectmatter of the different suits."
REASONING,The prolongation of the enquiry for ascertainment of the mesne profits cannot support a claim for equitable set off for the period subsequent to the delivery of possession to the plaintiff.
REASONING,The Privy 103 792 Council only affirmed this.decision.
REASONING,The result is that the decision of the High Court on this point is maintained.
PRECEDENT,793 The appellant 's last contention that the munafa (rent) should not be calculated on the principle laid down in Radhacharan vs Maharaja Ranjit Singh (1) but should have been assessed on a fair share of the profits of the land has no substance because the claim was not made in the grounds of appeal to the Privy Council and was not even mentioned in the additional grounds of appeal.
RPC,The parties will bear their own costs in all these appeals.
RPC,Appeals dismissed.
FACTS,"Paragraph 21, which is the penultimate paragraph in the will, further lays down that if all the three contingencies fail and no adoption is taken, the male child or children born to Gnanambal shall inherit as grand sons all the properties of the testator, subject to the conditions specified in the will."
FACTS,"These, in brief, are the dispositions made in the will."
REASONING,This intention has to be gathered primarily from the language of the document which is to be read as a whole without indulging in any conjecture or speculation as to what the testator would have done if he had been better informed or better advised.
PRECEDENT,"In construing the language of the will as the Privy Council observed in Venkata Narasimha vs Parthasarathy (1), ""the courts are entitled and bound to bear in mind other matters than merely the words used."
PRECEDENT,"They must consider the surrounding circumstances, the position of the testator, 'his family relationship, the probability that he would use words in a particular sense, and many other things which are often summed up in the somewhat picturesque figure 'The court is entitled to put itself into the testator 's armchair ' ."
REASONING,"In all cases it must loyally carry out the will as properly construed, and this duty is universal, and is true alike of wills of every nationality and every religion or rank of life."" A question is sometimes raised as to whether in constru ing a will the court should lean against (1) 42 I.A. 51 at p.70."
PRECEDENT,"As Lord Justice Romer observed in Re Edwards; Jones vs Jones (1), ""it cannot be that merely with a view to avoiding intestacy you are to do otherwise than construe plain words according to their plain meaning""."
REASONING,"Besides these dispositions, there were certain gifts for charity which were to be met out of the income of the properties given to the wife and the adoptive mother for their lives."
REASONING,"The other is in paragraph 13, which merely says that Nagammal was to get it for life as stated in paragraph 5."
REASONING,We do not think that this is the correct way of reading the document.
REASONING,"In the second part of the will, which is comprised in paragraphs 11 to 16, the testator sets out the modifications which he desires to make in the earli er dispositions in case a son of one of his nephews was adopted by the widow."
REASONING,"The statement in paragraph 13 may, after all, be a loose expres sion which the testator used only for the purpose of empha sising that the Kothangudi village would be enjoyed by Nagammal even if Gnanambal 's son was not adopted."
REASONING,It is not a question of making a new will for the testator or inventing a bequest for certain persons simply because the will shows that they were the objects of the testator 's affection.
REASONING,They were not contingent gifts in the sense of being made dependent upon the adoption of Gnanambal 's son by the wife of the testator.
REASONING,"Having regard to the meticulous care with which the testator seems to have attempted to provide for the differ ent contingencies that might arise and the anxiety displayed by him in making an effective disposition of all the proper ties he owned, it is not probable that he would omit to make any provision regarding the future devolution of the Kothan gudi village if he really thought that such direction had to be repeated in the latter part of the will."
RPC,It is not necessary for the purpose of the present case to invoke any rule of presumption against.
RPC,"intestacy, but if the presumption exists at all, it certainly fortifies the conclusion which we have arrived at."
RPC,"The result is that the appeal is allowed, the judgment and decree of the of the High Court are set aside and those of the Subordinate Judge restored."
RPC,The appellant will have costs of all the courts.
RPC,Appeal allowed.
FACTS,It would thus be seen that the present application was filed after the lapse of 12 years from the date of the final decree and 3 years from the date of the final order on the previous application.
FACTS,"The Subordinate Judge held that the execution applica tion was not barred, agreeing with every one of these con tentions."
FACTS,"In this connection, it is as well to set out very briefly the nature of the concealment and the steps taken by the judgment debtor to achieve the same."
FACTS,"The 'judgment debtor has, by fraud, prevented the execution of the decree within 12 years before the date of the application for execution by the decree holder and therefore the decree under consideration is capable of being executed."
REASONING,"It would be convenient to set out here in extenso sec tion 48, Civil Procedure Code, and section 18 of the Limita tion Act before we proceed to consider the soundness of the arguments advanced by both sides in support of the positions they have taken up."
PRECEDENT,The former view was taken in an early Madras case Kannu Pillay vs Chellathammal and ) Others(1) and receives support from the decision reported in Sri Raja Venkata Lingama Nayanim Bahadur Varu and Another vs Raja Inuganti Rajaopala Venkata Narasimha Rayanim Bahadur Varu and five Others(2)to which our learned brother Mr. Justice Patanjali Sastri was a party.
PRECEDENT,The latter view ( (1) [1898] M.I.J. Mad.
PRECEDENT,861 is indicated in M.R.M.A.S.P. Ramathan Chefliar vs Mahalingam Chetti(1) by a Bench of which Sir Madhavan Nair J. was a member.
PRECEDENT,"It is not necessary to determine which view is correct, as we have here definite findings of both the Courts below that there was fraud preventing the execution of the decree within the meaning of Section 48 of the Civil Procedure Code."
PRECEDENT,The appellant thus escapes the bar of the 12 years ' period and he has a fresh starting point of limitation from the date of the fraud for section 48 of the Civil Procedure Code.
PRECEDENT,"Having thus got over the difficulty in his way under section 48 of the Code of Civil Procedure, he has next to meet the objection under the Limitation Act."
PRECEDENT,"On behalf of the appellant, it was urged that section 18 of the Limita tion Act applied to the facts and that the right to apply accrued to the appellant when the fraud by the judgment debtor became known to him in 1946."
PRECEDENT,No reliance was placed on section 18 of the Limitation Act in the courts below and no reference to it is found in the grounds of appeal to this court.
PRECEDENT,It is however mentioned for the first time in the appellant 's statement of the case.
PRECEDENT,"If the facts proved and found as established are sufficient to make out a case of fraud within the meaning of section 18, this objection may not be serious, as the question of the applicability of the section will be only a question of law and such a question could be raised at any stage of the case and also in the final court of appeal."
PRECEDENT,The following obser vations of Lord Watson in Connecticut Fire Insurance Co. vs Kavanagh (2) are relevant.
PRECEDENT,"The expediency of (1) 1.L.R. (2) 862 adopting that course may be doubted when the plea cannot be disposed of without deciding nice questions of fact in considering which the court of ultimate review is placed in a much less advantageous position than the courts below."" Mr. Setalvad, however, urged that the appellant should not be allowed to rely on section 18 now for the first time and that even if fraud within the meaning of that section had been pleaded the respondent might have adduced counter evidence by himself going into the witness box or otherwise."
PRECEDENT,As held in Kalyanasundaram Pillai vs Vaithilinga Vanniar (1) section 48 (2) extends the 12 years ' period of closure by a further period of similar duration but the necessity of resort to article 182 is not thereby obviated.
REASONING,"The fraud pleaded namely suppression of owner ship of the 'Prabhat ' newspaper, did not conceal from him his right to make an application for execution of the de cree."
RPC,For the reasons given above we concur in the conclusion reached by the High Court and dismiss the appeal with costs.
RPC,Appeal dismissed.
